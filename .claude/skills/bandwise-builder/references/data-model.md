# Data model, tenancy, and RLS

Tenancy exists from migration `0001`. It is never bolted on later.

## Tenancy rules

1. Every tenant table has `org_id uuid not null references organizations(id)`. Platform tables have no `org_id` and are listed under [Platform tables](#platform-tables-no-org_id). One exception: `price_books` is a hybrid table whose platform default rows have `org_id` null ([Billing and usage](#billing-and-usage)).
2. Every tenant table has an RLS policy (template below, or the hybrid policy on `price_books`) and a composite index that starts with `org_id`. Every foreign key has an index whose leading columns are the key's own columns, so a composite `(org_id, parent_id)` key needs an index on `(org_id, parent_id, ...)`. Postgres does not add one for you, and deletes and joins on the parent scan the child table without it.
3. App code touches the database only through `withTenant(ctx, tx => repo.method(tx, ...))`. It opens a transaction, runs `select set_config('app.org_id', $1, true)` (transaction-local, safe with pooled connections), and hands back repositories that also add the org filter. Two layers: if the repo forgets, RLS catches it; if RLS is misconfigured, the repo tests catch it.
4. Raw `db` handles are never exported from `packages/db`.
5. Cross-tenant access returns **404**, never 403, so existence doesn't leak.
6. Seeds and fixtures always create at least two orgs.

### RLS policy template

```sql
alter table question_sets enable row level security;
alter table question_sets force row level security;

create policy tenant_isolation on question_sets
  using (org_id = (select nullif((select current_setting('app.org_id', true)), '')::uuid))
  with check (org_id = (select nullif((select current_setting('app.org_id', true)), '')::uuid));
```

`nullif` matters. Once a transaction-local `app.org_id` has been set on a pooled connection, `current_setting('app.org_id', true)` returns `''` (not null) after that transaction ends, and `''::uuid` raises an error. The generated policies in `packages/db/src/rls.ts` always read the setting through `nullif`.

Both `select`s matter too. A scalar subquery that never touches the row becomes an initplan, which Postgres runs once per statement; a bare `current_setting(...)` in a policy runs once for every row it checks. The outer `select` puts the whole value, `nullif` and the cast included, in the initplan. The inner one is the text Supabase's performance advisor looks for (lint 0003, `auth_rls_initplan` matches `select current_setting(`), so the outer `select` alone runs just as fast but still shows up as a finding.

One permissive policy per role and command. Postgres ORs every permissive policy that applies and evaluates each one, and the advisor flags two on the same table, role and command (lint 0006, where a policy with no `to` counts for every role). So:

- A table with a second read path gets one policy per command, with the extra arm OR'ed into `select` only: `tenant_read`, `tenant_insert`, `tenant_update`, `tenant_delete`. `organizations`, `memberships` and `invitations` do this for the pre-org lookups on `app.user_id` (ADR-002).
- A table where two roles need different rules names the role on each policy. On `price_books`, `audit_log` and `events` the tenant policies are `to bandwise_app` and `platform_rows` is `to bandwise_platform`.

The app connects as a login role that is a member of `bandwise_app` (NOLOGIN, no `BYPASSRLS`, no `SUPERUSER`), so policies `to bandwise_app` apply to it through membership. Platform rows (`org_id` null in `price_books`, `audit_log` and `events`, and the platform tables) are written by the `bandwise_platform` role, whose policies match only `org_id is null`; since migration 0004 the tenant policies on those tables do not apply to it, so it never reaches an org's rows. The app role is never a member of it. Migration 0001 creates both roles, and its security block is generated from the table classes in `packages/db/src/schema/classes.ts`.

Policies are data in `rls.ts`, one generation per migration that shipped them: generation 1 in `0001_init.sql`, generation 2 (the current set) in `0004_supabase_performance_advisor.sql`, which drops every generation 1 policy and creates generation 2. A shipped generation never changes. To change a policy, add a generation and a block for a new migration. `schema.test.ts` checks each block against its file, checks `pg_policies` against the current generation, and mirrors advisor lints 0001, 0003 and 0006.

## Tables

Actor columns named `*_user_id` and `*_token_id` come in pairs. A person acting in the console fills only the user column. An agent token fills both: the token and the user it belongs to ([security.md](security.md)). A single actor column is allowed only where no token can act: `approval_requests.decided_by_user_id`, `run_feedback.confirmed_by_user_id`, `dataset_cases.label_confirmed_by`, and the platform admin columns (`entitlement_overrides.set_by`, `audit_log.impersonator_id`).

### Identity and tenancy
- `users`, `sessions`, `accounts`, `verification_tokens`, `two_factors`: Better Auth's tables (ADR-002), reached only through the auth store in `packages/db/src/auth-store.ts`, which the console's auth adapter wraps. Add `platform_role` (`null` or `superadmin`). Migration 0006 adds the two-factor plugin's `verified`, `failed_verification_count` and `locked_until`. Verification identifiers (reset tokens, two-factor challenges) are stored hashed. The organization plugin's tables map onto `organizations`, `memberships` and `invitations`, whose `select` policy also admits pre-org lookups on `app.user_id` (ADR-002).
- `organizations`: `id, slug (unique), name, status (active|suspended|deleted), key_mode (byo|platform), default_system_one_provider (typesafe|openrouter, default typesafe), state_retention_days (default 30), answers_retention_days (default 180), dataset_retention_days (null = the state retention), pii_mode (off|redact_logs|redact_logs_and_input), settings jsonb, created_at`.
  - Retention rules and the learning retention copy are in [security.md](security.md). Only an admin can raise `dataset_retention_days`, and the change is audited.
  - `settings` keys: `agentApprovals` (`required` (default), `production_only` or `off`; [security.md](security.md)), `allowPreviewModels` (bool, default false; [system-one-models.md](system-one-models.md)), `reviewerHourlyRateUsd` (number, used for the default review cost in [savings-model.md](savings-model.md)).
- `memberships`: `org_id, user_id, role (owner|admin|editor|reviewer|viewer)`, unique `(org_id, user_id)`.
- `invitations`: `org_id, email, role, token_hash, invited_by_user_id, invited_by_token_id, expires_at, accepted_at`.
- `device_codes`: auth table for the device flow (RFC 8628). `device_code_hash, user_code, client (cli|mcp|extension), requested_scopes text[], org_id null, user_id null, status (pending|approved|denied|used), expires_at (10 minutes), created_at`. Like `sessions`, it has no tenant RLS: only the `/api/v1/auth/device/*` route handlers read it. `org_id` and `user_id` stay null until a person approves the code in a console session, which mints an agent token.

### Keys and agent tokens
- `org_system_one_keys` (ADR-011 renames it from `org_typesafe_keys` before the first migration ships): `org_id, provider (typesafe|openrouter), ciphertext, iv, auth_tag, wrapped_dek, kek_id, key_last4, fingerprint, status (active|invalid|revoked), models text[], created_by_user_id, created_by_token_id, rotated_at`. Unique `(org_id, provider)`, so an org holds at most one key per provider. `models` holds the registry ids the key can reach on that provider, refreshed on save, on rotation and nightly ([system-one-models.md](system-one-models.md)). Validation differs by provider ([security.md](security.md)).
- `agent_tokens`: `org_id, user_id, name, client (cli|mcp|extension|console), prefix ('sa_live_'), hash (sha256 + pepper), scopes text[], role_ceiling, set_ids uuid[] (null = all), daily_spend_cap_micro_usd null, expires_at (at most 90 days), revoked_at, last_used_at, created_at`. Each token belongs to one user in one org. Effective role and minting rules are in [security.md](security.md).
- `org_webhook_secrets`: `org_id, ciphertext, iv, auth_tag, wrapped_dek, kek_id, created_at, rotated_at`. Envelope-encrypted like `org_system_one_keys`. Signs org event webhooks and plugin action webhooks ([events.md](events.md)).

### Apps and integration
- `apps`: `org_id, name, description, language (ts|py|other), framework text null, repo_url text null, allowed_origins text[]`.
- `app_tokens`: `org_id, app_id, kind (secret|publishable), prefix (sk_live_|sk_test_|pk_live_), hash (sha256 + pepper), channel (production|staging, default production), scopes text[], set_ids uuid[] (null = all), rpm_limit, expires_at, revoked_at, last_used_at, created_by_user_id, created_by_token_id`. Scopes may include `runs:write` and `feedback:write`, on `sk_` tokens only. A token runs only on its bound channel.
- `app_opportunities`: `org_id, app_id, source (agent|console), location jsonb null ({ file, lines }), current_approach (regex|if_else|llm_call|manual|other), decision_summary, primitive_guess, pattern (fan_out|confidence_routing|composite_scoring|intent_routing|cascade|top_choice|keep_in_code), ten_second_fit bool, status (proposed|accepted|rejected|built), set_id null, created_by_user_id, created_by_token_id, created_at`. Holds summaries, never source code. The `Opportunity` contract is in [deploy-and-codegen.md](deploy-and-codegen.md).
- `app_set_bindings`: `org_id, app_id, set_id, channel, target (managed|managed_typed|standalone), runtime (ts|py|http), interface_major, interface_hash, generator_version null, source_ref text null (commit SHA or PR URL), created_by_user_id, created_by_token_id, created_at, removed_at`. Written by `bandwise codegen`, the codegen endpoint when `appId` is passed, and the console "Use in app" action. A set's consumers (bindings plus apps with runs in the last 30 days) feed the `interface.breaking` lint ([deploy-and-codegen.md](deploy-and-codegen.md)).

### Decision domain
- `projects`: `org_id, name, slug`.
- `goals`: `org_id, project_id, title, description, quality_target jsonb (QualityTarget), business_kpi text null, owner_id, archived_at`. `QualityTarget` and its tier defaults are in [confidence-policy.md](confidence-policy.md#quality-targets).
- `question_sets`: `org_id, project_id, goal_id, slug (unique per org), name, description, protected bool, labeling jsonb (LabelingPolicy), dispatch_actions_on_staging bool (default false), value_settings jsonb ({ errorCostUsd, reviewCostUsd }), gate_margins jsonb (default { coverageDrop: 0.02, reviewLoadRise: 0.10 }), storage_mode (full|redacted|hash_only, default full), user_generated bool (default false), result_cache_ttl_seconds int null, system_one_provider (typesafe|openrouter) null, draft_version_id, archived_at, created_by_user_id, created_by_token_id`.
  - There is no rollout column. The rollout stage lives on `release_pointers`.
  - `labeling` is the labeling policy and `gate_margins` holds the regression and experiment margins ([effectiveness-loop.md](effectiveness-loop.md)). `value_settings` feeds the quality-adjusted value ([savings-model.md](savings-model.md)).
  - `storage_mode` is the per-set storage mode in [security.md](security.md#pii-and-data-handling): `full` keeps state, `redacted` keeps redacted state, `hash_only` keeps only `runs.state_hash`. `user_generated` marks sets whose input comes from untrusted users; such sets need adversarial cases for the shadow to controlled gate ([security.md](security.md#state-is-untrusted)). `result_cache_ttl_seconds` null means the result cache is off; a value turns it on, for pinned models only ([architecture.md](architecture.md#caching)).
  - `system_one_provider` null means the org's `default_system_one_provider` (ADR-011, proposed). The resolved value reaches core as `RunSettings.systemOneProvider`. Until ADR-011 is accepted, `set.update` does not expose it.
  - All of these settings and `dispatch_actions_on_staging` change through `set.update` (`name, protected, labeling, dispatchActionsOnStaging, valueSettings, gateMargins, storageMode, userGenerated, resultCacheTtlSeconds`), never through the spec. Changing `storage_mode` to a less private mode (`hash_only` to `redacted` or `full`, or `redacted` to `full`) is a PII change, so it is high risk for agents.
- `question_set_versions`: `org_id, set_id, version int (unique with set_id), status (draft|published|archived), spec jsonb, spec_hash, interface_hash, interface_major int, model, changelog, source (console|api|cli|mcp|studio|upgrade|proposal), source_ref text null (commit SHA), created_by_user_id, created_by_token_id, published_by_user_id, published_by_token_id, published_at, eval_run_id`.
  - A trigger rejects updates once `status = 'published'`. A partial unique index allows one draft per set.
  - `interface_hash` and `interface_major` come from `SetInterface` ([spec-schema.md](spec-schema.md)). `source` and `source_ref` let `bandwise spec diff` say which side changed.
- `release_pointers`: `org_id, set_id, channel (production|staging), version_id, rollout_stage (inactive|shadow|controlled|full|paused), active_experiment_id null, updated_at`. Primary key `(set_id, channel)`.
  - This is the only place the rollout stage is stored. It changes only through `rollout.change` ([management-api.md](management-api.md)).
  - A channel's first publish creates its pointer at `inactive`. Who changed a pointer is on its `release_events` row.
- `release_events`: `org_id, set_id, channel, from_version_id, to_version_id, kind (publish|rollback|promote|rollout_change|auto_demote|experiment_start|experiment_promote), from_stage null, to_stage null, reason, actor_user_id, actor_token_id, approval_id, at`. Auto-demote rows have no user or token; the audit row records the system actor.
- `experiments`: `org_id, set_id, channel, champion_version_id, challenger_version_id, kind (version|model|policy), sample_pct, min_runs, min_labeled, status (running|promoted|stopped), result jsonb, decided_by_user_id, decided_by_token_id, created_at`. At most one running experiment per `(set_id, channel)`. Rules in [effectiveness-loop.md](effectiveness-loop.md).
- `proposals`: `org_id, set_id, kind (tune_thresholds|model_upgrade|question_fix|add_none_option|split_question|narrow_state|label_more|demote), evidence jsonb, patch jsonb null, draft_version_id null, eval_run_id null, metrics_delta jsonb, rationale, status (open|accepted|rejected|expired), created_by_kind (system|user|agent), created_by_user_id, created_by_token_id, created_at`. Accepting a proposal creates a draft only.

### Runs, review, evals

#### `runs` (partitioned by month)

`id (uuidv7), org_id, project_id, set_id, version_id, channel, rollout, experiment_id null, arm (champion|challenger) null, source (console|playground|api|embed|extension|mcp|eval|cli|ingest), app_id, actor_user_id, actor_token_id, key_mode, system_one_provider (typesafe|openrouter), parent_run_id uuid null, model_requested, model_resolved, typesafe_request_id, interface_major, external_ref null, state jsonb null, state_hash, stages jsonb, checks jsonb, answers jsonb, decisions jsonb, run_band, overall_action, policy_action null, route, warnings jsonb, input_tokens, output_tokens, system_one_cost_micro_usd null, system_one_calls, cf_input_tokens, cf_output_tokens, counterfactual_micro_usd, counterfactual_mode, comparator_model, savings_micro_usd, savings_kind, savings_suppressed null, escalation_cost_micro_usd, llm_calls_made, llm_calls_avoided, context_tokens_pruned, latency_ms, status (ok|error|rate_limited|quota_exceeded), error_code, created_at`.

- Indexes: `(org_id, set_id, created_at desc)`, `(org_id, source, created_at)`, `(org_id, external_ref)`, `(org_id, experiment_id)`, `(org_id, version_id)`. They are partitioned indexes, so every partition gets them, including ones `bandwise_ensure_runs_partition` makes later.
- `rollout` is the rollout stage read from the channel pointer at run time. It is a record of what applied, not a setting.
- `answers` always holds the full `SystemOneAnswer` JSON, including probabilities. `includeProbabilities` only shapes the response. Policy replay and set health depend on this.
- `input_tokens` and `output_tokens` are System One tokens. LLM escalation spend is in `escalation_cost_micro_usd`.
- `system_one_cost_micro_usd` sums each call's provider-reported `usage.cost` when present, else its price book cost. It is null when a call has neither, which happens in BYO key mode (warning `model_unpriced`).
- `system_one_provider` comes from `RunSinkRecord.provider`. `model_resolved` stores the response `model` as sent, so OpenRouter runs hold ids such as `typesafe/jev-1.13-20260917`.
- `parent_run_id` is set on a linked run that a `set` fallback started ([spec-schema.md](spec-schema.md) section 7). The parent's decision carries the linked run's id as `fallbackRunId`.
- `stages` stores `result.stages` (each stage with its calls). `RunSinkRecord.stages` holds per-stage totals only for `usage_events`.
- Standalone exports write rows with `source = 'ingest'` through `POST /api/v1/runs/ingest` ([api.md](api.md)).

**RunResult to runs columns.** Every field of `RunResult` ([savings-model.md](savings-model.md)) maps to one column, or is derived from one. USD fields are stored as micro-USD integers.

#### Truth and review
- `run_feedback`: `id, org_id, run_id, decision_id null, observed jsonb, source (app|reviewer|audit|agent), observed_at, user_id null, token_id null, review_item_id null, idempotency_key, confirmed_by_user_id null, confirmed_at null, created_at`. Unique `(org_id, idempotency_key)`, index `(org_id, run_id)`.
  - `decision_id` null means the report is about the run's route.
  - Every truth source writes here: `POST /api/v1/feedback`, audit label items and reviewer resolutions. Resolving a review item writes an `audit` row when the item carries a `sample_rate`, otherwise a `reviewer` row, or an `agent` row when an agent token resolved it.
  - `agent` rows count toward gates and health only once `confirmed_by_user_id` is set by a person.
- `review_items`: `org_id, run_id (null for Studio items), studio_example_id null, set_id, decision_id, kind (action|label), reason (action|audit|near_threshold|challenger_diff|studio), sample_rate null, band, suggested jsonb, status (open|pending_confirmation|resolved|dismissed), assignee_id, resolution jsonb, resolved_by_user_id, resolved_by_token_id, resolved_at, due_at, add_to_dataset bool`.
  - `kind = 'action'` is created exactly when a decision's `effectiveAction` is `review`. `kind = 'label'` comes from the labeling policy or the Studio. Label items never block the caller or change `effectiveAction`.
  - `pending_confirmation` means an agent token resolved the item and a person must confirm it (`ReviewStore.confirm`). It stays out of gates and health until confirmed.
  - `sample_rate` is set when the labeling policy's random audit picked the decision, including on an action item it reused. Resolving an item with a `sample_rate` writes an `audit` row, and metrics weight it by `1 / sample_rate`.

#### Datasets and evals
- `datasets`: `org_id, set_id, name`.
- `dataset_cases`: `org_id, dataset_id, run_id null, version_id null, model_resolved null, state jsonb, state_hash, answers jsonb null, expected jsonb, source (manual|review|import|studio|production), label_source (reviewer|app|studio|import|agent), label_confirmed_by null, split (drafting|calibration|test), tags text[], created_at`.
  - `split` is set at insert from a hash of `state_hash` and never changes (a trigger rejects updates to it). Imports cannot set it.
  - `source = 'production'` rows come from the learning retention copy ([security.md](security.md)): state redacted per `pii_mode`, full answers, version and resolved model.
  - Cases follow `organizations.dataset_retention_days`. Deletion requests cascade to them.
- `dataset_snapshots`: `org_id, dataset_id, case_ids uuid[], snapshot_hash, created_at`. Immutable. The regression gate scores the champion and the candidate on the same snapshot.
- `eval_runs`: `org_id, set_id, version_id, dataset_id, snapshot_id, model, repeats int null, job_id, status, metrics jsonb, cost_micro_usd, created_by_user_id, created_by_token_id, started_at, finished_at`.
- `eval_case_results`: `org_id, eval_run_id, case_id, run_id, per_question jsonb`. Test-split rows are read only to compute aggregate metrics.

#### Studio
- `studio_sessions`: `org_id, goal_id, set_id null, opportunity_id null, status, intent jsonb, definition text, fit_test jsonb, created_by_user_id, created_by_token_id, created_at`. Improve mode sessions carry the `set_id` of the published set they reopen.
- `studio_examples`: `org_id, session_id, state jsonb, label jsonb, reason, label_source (human|agent|review), split (drafting|calibration|test), burned_at null, created_at`. `burned_at` is set when a calibration case's per-case result was returned. The holdout rules are in [definition-studio.md](definition-studio.md).

#### Rollups
- `question_daily`: keyed `(org_id, day, set_id, version_id, model_resolved, question_id)`. Columns: `n, band_high, band_medium, band_low, answer_hist jsonb, mean_confidence, labeled_n, correct_n, review_created`. Irrelevant decisions are not counted. Built nightly; set health reads it ([effectiveness-loop.md](effectiveness-loop.md)).
- `usage_daily`: see [savings-model.md](savings-model.md).

### Billing and usage
- `billing_accounts`: `org_id (unique), stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id, plan, status, current_period_start, current_period_end, cancel_at, grace_until`.
- `entitlement_overrides`: `org_id, key, value, reason, set_by`. Platform admin only.
- `usage_events` (outbox): `org_id, run_id, kind (system_one_input_tokens|run), model (resolved), provider (typesafe|openrouter), quantity, key_mode, reported_to_stripe_at`. Written in the same transaction as the run. The model lets platform-key billing price each model at its own rate.
- `usage_daily`: rollup, see [savings-model.md](savings-model.md).
- `price_books`: `org_id (null = platform default), model, provider (typesafe|openrouter) null, display_name, input_per_mtok_micro_usd, output_per_mtok_micro_usd, updated_by_user_id, updated_by_token_id, updated_at`. Unique `(org_id, model, provider)` with `nulls not distinct`, so each model has one platform row per provider value and at most one override per org and provider.
  - `provider` null means the price holds on every provider. A row for the run's provider wins over the null row (ADR-011). Provider-reported `usage.cost` wins over both.
  - Hybrid table, the one exception to tenancy rule 1. With `<org>` the setting read from the [template](#rls-policy-template): read policy `tenant_read ... to bandwise_app using ((org_id = <org>) or (org_id is null))`; write policies `to bandwise_app` with `org_id = <org>`. Platform rows (`org_id` null) are written only by the `bandwise_platform` role, through `platform_rows`.
  - The `PriceBook` port runs inside `withTenant`, so it sees the platform rows and the caller's own overrides, and an org row wins over the platform row for the same model.
  - The cross-tenant suite checks that org A cannot read or write org B's override, and that both orgs read the platform rows.
  - `model` is an exact model id. For System One rows it must be a versioned id in `system_one_models`; alias rows are rejected, because they would misprice runs after the alias moves. Comparator rows use the provider's exact model id.
  - Seed rows are listed in [savings-model.md](savings-model.md#price-book).

Plans live in code (`packages/billing/src/plans.ts`, typed). The database holds only overrides.

### Admin, jobs and events
- `audit_log` (append-only; the app role has no UPDATE or DELETE grant): `id, org_id (null for platform events), actor_type (user|agent|app|system), client (console|api|cli|mcp|extension|job), actor_user_id, actor_token_id, actor_role (the effective role when the action ran), approval_id, impersonator_id, action, target_type, target_id, diff jsonb, ip, user_agent, created_at`. `action` is the operation id ([management-api.md](management-api.md)).
- `approval_requests`: `org_id, op_id, input jsonb, input_hash, if_match text null, requested_by_token_id, requested_by_user_id, reason, status (pending|approved|rejected|expired|executed), decided_by_user_id, decided_at, expires_at, result jsonb, created_at`. `if_match` is the `If-Match` value the agent sent, re-checked when the approved request runs. Rules in [management-api.md](management-api.md#approvals).
- `idempotency_keys`: `org_id, actor_key, key, op_id, request_hash, response_status, response jsonb, created_at`. Unique `(org_id, actor_key, key)`. Pruned after 24 hours.
- `jobs`: `org_id, kind, status (queued|running|succeeded|failed), input, result, error, created_by_user_id, created_by_token_id, created_at, finished_at`.
- `events`: the event feed, see [events.md](events.md). Pruned after 30 days.
- `webhook_endpoints` (Phase 5): `org_id, url, types text[], enabled, created_by_user_id, created_by_token_id, created_at` ([events.md](events.md)).
- `plugin_configs`: `org_id, plugin_id, version, enabled, config_ciphertext`.

### Platform tables (no `org_id`)

These have no tenant RLS policy. The app role can read them; only the audited platform admin path writes them. `price_books` is not listed here: it holds platform rows and org rows, with the hybrid policy under [Billing and usage](#billing-and-usage).

- `system_one_models`: one row per `ModelProfile` ([system-one-models.md](system-one-models.md)). Every write is audited.
- `system_one_model_routes`: one row per `ModelRoute` (ADR-011): `model_id, provider, provider_model_id, pinned, resolved_ids text[], limits jsonb, docs_url, last_reviewed`. Primary key `(model_id, provider)`. There are no `typesafe` rows; TypeSafe is the identity route. Every write is audited.
- `model_alias_observations`: `provider, alias, resolved_id, first_seen, last_seen` ([system-one-models.md](system-one-models.md)). Unique `(provider, alias, resolved_id)`.
- `settings`: platform key/value: the global RPM budget per model, the default comparator, alert thresholds.
- `stripe_webhook_events`: `event_id (pk), type, processed_at`.

### Private platform tables (no `org_id`, no app grant)

The app role has no privilege on these at all. Only `bandwise_platform` reads and writes them, RLS is forced with one policy for that role, and the app reaches them only through a narrow `SECURITY DEFINER` function.

- `early_access_signups` (ADR-018, migration 0005): `id, email, name, company, role, use_case, source_page, ip_hash, created_at, confirmed_at, unsubscribed_at`. Unique on `lower(email)`. `ip_hash` is an HMAC-SHA256 of the client IP (`hashClientIp` in `packages/tenancy`). The public route calls `bandwise_early_access_submit(...)`, owned by `bandwise_platform`, which applies the limits (5 new signups per IP hash and 300 in total per rolling hour) and an idempotent insert, and returns only `accepted` or `rate_limited`. Platform admins read and delete through `platform_early_access.list` and `platform_early_access.remove`.

## Roles

| Role | Can |
|---|---|
| owner | Everything, including billing, delete org, transfer ownership |
| admin | Members, keys, apps, settings, retention, PII, price book |
| editor | Goals, sets, drafts, publish (unless set is `protected`), rollback, playground, datasets. Publishing to production on `controlled` or `full` sets and rollout changes still follow the gates. |
| reviewer | Work the review queue, label dataset cases |
| viewer | Read only |

Agent tokens act with role = min(`role_ceiling`, the user's membership role) and also need the scope. High-risk operations wait for a human approval ([security.md](security.md)).

The matrix lives in `packages/core/src/authz.ts` as `can(ctx, action, resource)`. Every operation calls it through `runOperation` ([management-api.md](management-api.md)), so Server Actions and route handlers get the same check. RLS is the backstop.

## Invariants (tested)

- A published version's `spec` never changes.
- Every run belongs to exactly one version, and that version belongs to the same org.
- `usage_events` exist for every successful run.
- `usage_events` carry the resolved model.
- Every mutation produces exactly one `audit_log` row.
- Every agent mutation records `actor_token_id` and the effective role (`audit_log.actor_role`).
- An approved request executes its stored input unchanged.
- Rollout exists only on `release_pointers`.
- Test-split cases never leave the server.
- Money columns are integers in micro-USD.

## Migrations

- Generate with `drizzle-kit generate`. Review the SQL. Never edit a migration that has been applied anywhere.
- Each new tenant table's migration includes its RLS policy and `org_id` index in the same file.
- The cross-tenant test suite is generated from the repository list; adding a repo without adding it to the suite fails CI.
- Migrations are listed in `migrations/meta/_journal.json` and applied in that order by `migrateDrizzle`, which records each file's hash in `bandwise_migrations`. A hand-written migration gets a journal entry and a snapshot copy of the previous one, like `drizzle-kit generate --custom`.
- Our files start at `0001`, and drizzle-kit numbers from `0000`, so `db:generate` writes its SQL and snapshot one number low and overwrites the newest snapshot. After generating: rename the SQL and the new snapshot up by one, restore the overwritten snapshot with `git checkout`, and fix the tag in `_journal.json`. The new snapshot's `prevId` must be the previous snapshot's `id`.
- `0002_close_data_api_roles.sql` closes `public` to Supabase's `anon`, `authenticated` and `service_role`. Supabase's default privileges grant them ALL on every table we create, and `service_role` bypasses RLS. After every run the migrator checks that none of them can reach the schema or anything in it, and fails the run if one can. Never grant them anything ([security.md](security.md#database-roles-on-supabase)). Runbook: `docs/runbooks/database.md`.
- `0003_pin_function_search_path.sql` pins `search_path` on the Bandwise functions (security advisor lint 0011).
- `0004_supabase_performance_advisor.sql` adds a covering index for 23 foreign keys and replaces the generation 1 policies with generation 2 ([template](#rls-policy-template)). It cleared performance advisor lints 0001, 0003 and 0006.

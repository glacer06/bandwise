# Phase 2: Tenancy, auth, keys, billing foundation

**Owners:** Platform / Tenancy, Billing / Savings, Console UI (shell), Security reviewer. **Needs:** Phase 1 schema.

## Platform / Tenancy
- [ ] Auth with Better Auth per ADR-002 (organization, admin and two-factor plugins, behind `resolveSession` in `packages/tenancy`, built-in member and org endpoints disabled): orgs, memberships, invites (7-day token links), five roles, active org
- [ ] Org switcher and `/[orgSlug]` routing
- [ ] BYO key vault with envelope encryption (KMS in prod), validate on save, rotate, invalid-key handling; validation stores the reachable model names in `org_system_one_keys.models` ([system-one-models.md](../system-one-models.md))
- [ ] Per-provider keys (ADR-011, once accepted): `org_system_one_keys` holds at most one key per `(org_id, provider)`; `key.get`, `key.rotate` and `key.revoke` take `provider`; `KeyResolver(ctx, provider)` never returns a key for another provider ([security.md](../security.md))
- [ ] Key validation per provider: TypeSafe with `GET /v1/models`; OpenRouter with its Models API plus one one-noul call, 401 rejects, 402 saves with a warning
- [ ] Registry sync per provider: OpenRouter keys list through OpenRouter's Models API (`typesafe/*`, `~typesafe/*`), never `client.models.list()`; unmapped OpenRouter ids alert the platform admin; the `~typesafe/jev-latest` target feeds alias detection ([system-one-models.md](../system-one-models.md), sections 6 and 15)
- [ ] Provider settings: `organizations.default_system_one_provider` through `settings.update`, and `question_sets.system_one_provider` through `set.update`; the pointer resolver fills `RunSettings.systemOneProvider`. Changing a set's provider re-runs the model lints
- [ ] Platform key mode, with a platform key per provider (`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`)
- [ ] App tokens (`sk_live_`, `sk_test_`, `pk_live_`): create (show once), scope, set allowlist, origins, channel binding (production by default), revoke. The `runs:write` and `feedback:write` scopes are for `sk_` tokens only.
- [ ] Agent tokens (`sa_live_`): role ceiling, scopes, 90-day maximum expiry, optional daily spend cap, created in settings; effective role is min(ceiling, current membership role), read on every request ([security.md](../security.md))
- [ ] Device flow: `POST /api/v1/auth/device/code` and `POST /api/v1/auth/device/token` (RFC 8628), approved in a console session
- [ ] `runOperation` steps per [management-api.md](../management-api.md): actor resolution, input validation, `can()`, the approval gate, idempotency and If-Match
- [ ] `approval_requests` and the approval step in `runOperation`; approved requests run their stored input unchanged
- [ ] `agentApprovals` org setting (`required` by default, `production_only`, `off`) with the always-gated list from [security.md](../security.md)
- [ ] Idempotency middleware on `idempotency_keys` (24 hours, same transaction as the operation)
- [x] Database hosting (ADR-018): Supabase hardening migration `0002_close_data_api_roles.sql` with the migrator's Data API role guard, the manual `db-migrate` workflow (`DATABASE_URL_MIGRATE` per GitHub Environment) and `docs/runbooks/database.md`
- [ ] Database hosting: GitHub Environments `preview` and `production` with `DATABASE_URL_MIGRATE`, first migration run on preview then production, Data API off, the app login role (member of `bandwise_app`) created with its password in the vault
- [ ] Browser token minting route `POST /api/v1/tokens/browser` with ES256 (`BANDWISE_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`, `kid`) and the JWKS at `/api/v1/.well-known/jwks.json`
- [ ] `org_webhook_secrets`, encrypted like System One keys
- [ ] Retention settings split: `state_retention_days`, `answers_retention_days`, `dataset_retention_days`
- [ ] Rate limiters: per org (plan), per token, an eval bucket (25 percent of org RPM by default, lowest priority), and a global budget per model from settings (about 1,000 RPM for `jev-1.13.0`, ADR-008) with per-org fair share. Limiter keys include the model. The 1,000 is about 83 percent of 1,200 RPM, the last per-model limit TypeSafe published. TypeSafe now sets limits per organization, in tokens per second and requests per second, so check the platform org's values in TypeSafe's developer console before setting budgets. How budgets follow per-organization limits waits on an ADR-008 amendment.
- [ ] Audit writes inside `withTenant` for every mutation, with `actor_type`, `client`, `actor_token_id` and `approval_id`
- [ ] Platform admin route group: org list, suspend, entitlement overrides, impersonation with banner

## Billing / Savings
- [ ] `plans.ts` with limits: runs/month, platform System One spend per month, RPM, seats, apps, sets, retention max, SSO, eval runs
- [ ] Stripe products, meters, Checkout, Customer Portal. Meter System One cost in micro-USD (or one meter per model), never raw tokens at one rate.
- [ ] Webhooks with idempotency table; grace period and read-only mode on failed payment
- [ ] Meter outbox job (usage events to Stripe, run ID as idempotency key)
- [ ] Usage events carry the resolved model
- [ ] Price book defaults and per-org overrides, keyed by exact versioned model ID ([savings-model.md](../savings-model.md))
- [ ] Quota guard reading `usage_daily` plus same-day Redis counter

## Console UI
- [ ] Shell: layout, org switcher, nav, settings pages (members, keys, apps, agent tokens, billing, retention, PII, agent approvals)
- [ ] Approvals inbox: list pending requests, approve or reject in a console session

## Docs site
- [ ] Docs pages ([team-playbook.md](../team-playbook.md#docs-site)): Organizations, members and roles; Provider keys (bring your own TypeSafe, OpenRouter or AI Gateway key, validation, rotation), and update Providers to drop its Phase 2 callout; Agent tokens and approvals (scopes, role ceiling, device flow), and update Agents and MCP; Plans, billing and quotas

## Exit gate
- One user in three orgs (SGR, Personal, Dallas style seed) switches with no data leak (Playwright).
- One Playwright test per role proves its permissions.
- Demoting a user removes the matching permissions from their agent tokens on the next request.
- An agent token hitting a high-risk operation gets 202 and a pending approval; a human approves in the console and the stored input runs.
- Log scrubber test: no key material (`sk_`, `pk_`, `sa_live_`, TypeSafe keys) in logs or responses.
- k6: one org at its limit does not move another org's p95 latency.
- k6: a 5,000-case eval in org A does not move org A production p95 by more than 10 percent.
- Stripe test clock: subscribe, run 1,000 runs, invoiced System One spend reconciles with `usage_daily` within 0.1%.
- Replaying a webhook is a no-op.

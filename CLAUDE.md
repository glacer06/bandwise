# Bandwise

Multi-tenant SaaS kit around TypeSafe's **System One** models (Jev is the first and the default). Orgs set up apps, build versioned question sets, tune confidence bands, publish them live, call them from any app by ID or through generated typed code, and see what every run cost and saved. It is headless first: the console, the `bandwise` CLI, the MCP server and agents share one management API.

**Always load the `bandwise-builder` skill** (`.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/SKILL.md`) before planning or writing code here. It holds the architecture, contracts, phase checklists, and team playbook. For Jev and other System One models themselves, install the official skill (`claude plugin marketplace add typesafe-ai/skills`, then `claude plugin install typesafe@typesafe-ai`) and read `https://docs.typesafe.ai/llms.txt`.

## Status

Phase 0 is done. Part two (monorepo scaffold, zod contracts, operation registry, `openapi.json`) is built and the gate is green. Nick accepted ADRs 002 to 010 on 2026-09-26 (Better Auth, key vault, cache, jobs runner, billing, headless parity, model registry, app integration, rollout pointers), and the contracts in `packages/core/src/contracts` are frozen. The ADR-009 Python and Standalone sections stay proposed. ADR-011 (OpenRouter as a second route to System One models) is proposed. Nick accepted ADR-012 (outage rule and liveness) on 2026-09-27 and the contracts carry `onUnavailable`. On 2026-09-27 Nick also accepted Amendment 1 to ADR-012 (outage rule defaults to `review`), ADR-013 (Vercel AI Gateway as a third route), ADR-014 (per-question calibration, Phase 3b), ADR-015 (escalation spend as the number owners tune) ADR-016 (the product and code are named Bandwise) and ADR-018 (everything on `bandwise.dev`: marketing at `www`, the app and `/api/v1` at `app`, docs at `docs`, `bandwise.ai` redirects; early-access signups in our database; Supabase as the database host, used as plain Postgres). Phase 1 code is merged and the gate is green; the typesafe fixtures are recorded and the live smoke test passed (D0); OpenRouter and Vercel fixtures still need `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`. The public docs site lives in `apps/docs` (docs.bandwise.dev). The marketing site lives in `apps/web` (www.bandwise.dev, design notes in `apps/web/DESIGN.md`). Before Phase 2, app.bandwise.dev shows the public the early-access page and serves the console only to signed-in internal-org members; see `docs/runbooks/early-access.md`. On 2026-09-28 Nick accepted ADR-020: the dogfood track (phase D) comes next, before the rest of Phase 2. Bandwise is used on Bandwise first, starting with Claude Code hooks on this repo, local with his own TypeSafe key, then hosted for the `internal` org, every set in `shadow` until he moves it. See `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-d.md`. D1's CLI side is built: `bandwise run --live`, receipts, `bandwise report`, `bandwise hook`, `bandwise hooks install` and the shadow dogfood sets in `.bandwise/sets/`, and since 2026-09-30 the three hooks are wired in `.claude/settings.json`, all in `shadow`; see `docs/runbooks/dogfood.md`. D0 is done: on 2026-09-30 Nick recorded the typesafe fixtures and passed `pnpm smoke` from his own shell. On 2026-09-29 Nick accepted ADR-020 Amendment 1 (launch profiles: `bandwise launch` may start the agent CLI with a model and effort from a reviewed profiles file). `bandwise launch --print` picks from `.bandwise/profiles.json` and starts nothing. `bandwise launch -- <claude args>` starts `claude` with the picked `--model` and `--effort` through `live/spawn.ts`, the only module allowed to start a program (NSI-741, merged 2026-09-30 after PJ's Security review). The task for the pick is `--task`, else the argument right after `-p`, else a lone argument; any other form uses the default with a notice. D2b to D3 are merged (PR #21, 2026-10-01, after PJ's Security review): `POST /api/v1/sets/{ref}/run` and the management operations behind `/api/v1` for the `internal` org only, the CLI remote mode (`spec`, `publish`, `rollback`, `rollout`, `report --remote`, and `bandwise hook` with `BANDWISE_TOKEN`), and the console. Console sign-in is Better Auth email and password with TOTP two-factor required before any page, sign-up closed, sessions only for internal-org members; the pages cover sets and the draft editor, releases, approvals, runs, savings and the review queue; see `docs/runbooks/console-access.md`. D2e is done: on 2026-10-05 Nick took the `internal` org live on app.bandwise.dev (bootstrap, console sign-in with two-factor, run-only hook token and CLI token in the Keychain). The hooks on this repo now call the hosted run endpoint, every set still in `shadow`, and one live publish and rollback of `done-check` passed with no redeploy. PJ's sign-in and tokens are still open; see `docs/runbooks/hosted-dogfood.md`. On 2026-10-01 Nick accepted ADR-022 (brand and design system v1, from PJ's brand kit): the files are in `brand/`, the spec is `DESIGN.md` and `BRAND-VOICE.md` at the root, and www, the console and the docs get restyled together on it. On 2026-10-01 Nick accepted ADR-021: Bandwise Gate (the done-check plus a shadow action gate) is the first plugin, Claude Code plugin and Claude connector first (NSI-743), ChatGPT after the Claude listing is stable (NSI-744), OAuth on the remote MCP server before anyone outside `internal` connects, and it opens only after 200 labelled Stop events with a 0.9 precision lower bound. NSI-743 steps 1 and 2 are built (D4 in phase-d.md): `/mcp` in the console with the six Bandwise Gate tools over `packages/mcp-server`, agent tokens only and `internal` only, and the `bandwise-gate` plugin in `plugins/claude-code` with `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`; see `docs/runbooks/bandwise-gate.md`. The privacy notice on www names TypeSafe as a processor. See `docs/PLAN.md` and `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/`.

## Golden rules

1. Tenant isolation everywhere: `org_id` + RLS on every tenant table, all DB access through `withTenant`.
2. System One keys never leave the server. No browser SDK usage.
3. `packages/core` is pure. No I/O.
4. Contracts in `packages/core/src/contracts` change only through an ADR.
5. Published versions are immutable. Pin a versioned model ID before a set enters controlled rollout.
6. Every mutation writes an audit row. Every run returns the standard `RunResult` envelope with cost and savings.
7. No live System One calls in unit tests.
8. Headless parity: every console capability is an operation that `/api/v1`, the CLI and the MCP server also expose.
9. Model facts (limits, question types, prices) are data from the model registry. Code identifiers say `systemOne`, not `jev`.
10. Agents propose, humans approve: high-risk agent operations wait for a human approval; moves toward safety are never gated.

## Env vars

`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (platform key for the OpenRouter route, ADR-011, and `--provider openrouter` smoke and fixtures), `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` (platform key for the Vercel AI Gateway route, ADR-013, and `--provider vercel` smoke and fixtures), `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL` (console origin for sign-in, for example `https://app.bandwise.dev`; unset turns sign-in off), `BANDWISE_CONSOLE_EMAILS` (optional comma-separated sign-in allowlist on top of internal-org membership), `BANDWISE_KEK`, `BANDWISE_JWT_SIGNING_KEY` (ES256 key for browser tokens), `BANDWISE_TOKEN_PEPPER` (HMAC pepper for app and agent token hashes, at least 32 characters), `SYSTEM_ONE_TRANSPORT` (`sdk` or `fixture`), `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `REDIS_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Never commit `.env*` files with values.

System One base URLs are constants in core (`SYSTEM_ONE_PROVIDER_BASE_URLS`), never env, so no env var can send an org key to another host. The provider is picked per org and per set, not per deployment.

Customer tools (`bandwise` CLI, MCP server) read `BANDWISE_TOKEN` and `BANDWISE_BASE_URL` or a named profile; they never hold a TypeSafe, OpenRouter or AI Gateway key. One exception (ADR-020): the CLI's local live mode (`bandwise run --live`, `bandwise hook`) reads the developer's own key from their environment, in one module, and never stores, prints or forwards it.

## Design and brand

Before any UI, copy or marketing work, read `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `BRAND-VOICE.md` and `DESIGN-STANDARDS.md`, and treat them as the spec (ADR-022). Tokens and marks live in `brand/`.

- Components read only the `--bw-*` semantic tokens from `brand/tokens/`. Never raw hex.
- Marks are supplied files. Never redraw, recolor or regenerate the ant or the B.
- The palette is cool only, with no warm tones. Bands always show their word and their number.
- Band thresholds come from each set's spec. The kit's 0.55 and 0.80 are examples only.
- The logo wordmark is lowercase "bandwise". In prose, "Bandwise" and "bandwise" are both fine; keep one form per document.
- Build against the gates in `DESIGN-STANDARDS.md`. Log any correction in `corrections.md`. Check new features against `scope.md`, and metrics against `measurement.md`.

## Writing rules for every doc, UI string, commit, and PR

- No em dashes to separate thoughts. Use a period or a comma.
- No emojis.
- Skip AI filler: leverage, utilize, delve, seamless, robust, comprehensive, cutting-edge, streamline, empower, unlock, furthermore, moreover.
- Plain words, short sentences mixed with longer ones, concrete examples.

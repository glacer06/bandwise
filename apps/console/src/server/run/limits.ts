// Limits for hosted runs, behind core's RateLimiter and QuotaGuard ports. Every hosted run is a real
// call on the platform key, so a leaked hook token must not be able to spend without limit, and
// minting more tokens must not buy more budget. Each limit holds at two levels: per caller (the
// agent token, the app key, or the person in a console session) and per org, over every caller.
//
// - a run rate: at most runsPerWindow runs per caller and orgRunsPerWindow runs per org in each
//   windowMs, in fixed windows;
// - a daily spend cap: the System One and escalation cost per UTC day, in micro-USD, per caller
//   (dailySpendCapMicroUsd) and per org (orgDailySpendCapMicroUsd).
//
// Spend is reserved before the run calls System One: the quota takes runSpendReserveMicroUsd from
// both day windows in one locked step, and refuses the run when either would pass its cap. So runs
// that start at the same time cannot all pass a check that reads the same total. When the run is
// stored, the reservation is settled to the run's real cost in the run's own transaction: the extra
// is charged, or the unused part given back. A charge that fails rolls the run row back with it, so
// a stored run is always counted. A run can still finish over the cap by what it cost beyond its
// reservation; the next one is refused. A run that fails before it is stored keeps its reservation.
//
// All of it lives in run_limits (migration 0008), one locked row per key, so the limits hold across
// every server instance. Keys are hashed before they reach the database. The engine turns a
// refusal into rate_limited (429) or token_budget_exceeded (402).

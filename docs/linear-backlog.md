# Linear backlog: Bandwise project (NSIMS team)

This file is the build backlog for Bandwise in Nick's Linear workspace **NSIMS**. It lives in the existing **Bandwise** project (`P-NSI-36`, https://linear.app/nsims/project/bandwise-ef1f69b9fa8c) inside the **NSIMS** team, next to the Embers projects. Issues are `NSI-n`. Nothing in Embers is created, renamed, or moved.

The source of truth is the phase checklists in `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/` (phases 0 to 7 plus `phase-3b.md` and `phase-4b.md`), the roles in `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/team-playbook.md`, and `docs/PLAN.md`. When a phase file changes, update this file in the same PR. The backlog has 211 issues and 745 points across 10 milestones. Phase 0 is done (part two built with a green gate, ADRs 002 to 010 accepted), and Phase 1 is next.

Section 4 holds the same backlog as JSON. Paths in descriptions are repo-relative.

Product decisions that shape this backlog: Bandwise is multi-tenant SaaS. ADR-002 (P0-18) settled the auth library on 2026-09-26: Better Auth with the organization, admin and two-factor plugins. Jev is the default System One model, and every contract is model-agnostic. Everything the UI does, agents can do headlessly through the same operations.

## 1. Setup notes

### Where things live in Linear

- **Project:** `Bandwise` (`P-NSI-36`) in team `NSIMS`. One project, not one per phase, so the Bandwise work stays in one place in the workspace project list.
- **Milestones:** one per phase inside the project. The "Projects" in sections 2 and 3 below map to these milestones:

| Backlog section | Linear milestone |
|---|---|
| Bandwise P0 | Phase 0: Skill, contracts, scaffold |
| Bandwise P1 | Phase 1: Core engine and data layer |
| Bandwise P2 | Phase 2: Tenancy, auth, keys, billing |
| Bandwise P3 | Phase 3: Console and management API |
| Bandwise P3b | Phase 3b: Effectiveness loop |
| Bandwise P4 | Phase 4: Embed kit |
| Bandwise P4b | Phase 4b: Integrate and deploy |
| Bandwise P5 | Phase 5: Plugins and templates |
| Bandwise P6 | Phase 6: Chrome extension |
| Bandwise P7 | Phase 7: Claude Code plugin and MCP |

### Labels

Each issue has exactly one role label from the **Bandwise role** group (single select), zero or more type labels, and `agent-created` (Nick's existing label for issues an agent files).

| Role label (Bandwise role group) | Owns |
|---|---|
| Architect | The builder skill, contracts, `openapi.json`, ADRs, boundary lint, the Phase 0 registry skeleton, merge order |
| Core Engine | `packages/core`, `packages/system-one-client`, `packages/llm-client` |
| Platform / Tenancy | `packages/db`, `packages/tenancy`, `apps/console/src/server/**`, `apps/console/app/api/**`, audit, cache, registry jobs |
| Billing | `packages/billing`, savings rollups, reports, price book |
| Console UI | `apps/console/app/(org)/**` and `app/(platform)/**`; calls operations, never repositories |
| Embed Kit | `packages/client`, `packages/react`, `apps/example-embed` |
| QA / Evals | `packages/evals`, fixtures, cross-tenant suite, Playwright, k6, CI gates, the parity test |
| Integrations | `packages/cli`, `packages/mcp-server`, `packages/codegen`, `packages/client-py`, `plugins/claude-code`, `examples/*` |
| Quality / Learning | `packages/core/src/learning`, `apps/console/src/jobs/learning`, `effectiveness-loop.md` |
| Extensions | `packages/plugin-sdk`, `plugins-builtin`, `apps/extension-chrome` |
| Security review | Threat model and sign-off on keys, authz, tokens, approvals, webhooks, embed, extension, and codegen output |
| Docs | Skill references, API docs, recipes, quickstart |

Type labels are flat because multi-select label groups are off in this workspace. `Security` is the existing NSIMS label.

| Type label | Use it when the issue |
|---|---|
| `bandwise:contract` | Implements or changes a contract: zod schemas in `packages/core/src/contracts`, `openapi.json`, or a plugin interface. After the freeze, a change needs an ADR. |
| `bandwise:adr` | Writes, reviews, or decides an ADR. |
| `Security` | Touches keys, tokens, authz, approvals, PII, webhooks, the extension, or anything the Security reviewer must see. |
| `bandwise:tenancy` | Touches `org_id`, RLS, `withTenant`, repositories, per-org data, or the cross-tenant suite. |
| `bandwise:headless` | Touches the operation registry, `/api/v1` management routes, the CLI, the MCP server, agent tokens, or approvals. |
| `bandwise:models` | Touches the model registry, `ModelProfile`, pricing by model, preflight limits, model lints, or model upgrades. |
| `bandwise:docs` | Writes docs, recipes, templates, or customer skills. |

### Workflow states and estimates

- Workflow states stay at the Linear defaults. This backlog uses three of them: `Done` for the five Phase 0 part one issues, `Todo` for every Phase 0 part two issue (the first build), and `Backlog` for everything else. Move a project's issues to `Todo` when its dependencies land.
- Estimates use the Fibonacci scale. Issues use 1, 2, 3, 5 or 8 points. Anything bigger was split.
- Blocked-by links use the stable local IDs (for example `P0-09`). After creation, each issue's description ends with its local ID, so a later session can map local IDs to `NSI-n` keys and never create a duplicate.

### Conventions

- Titles are imperative and under 80 characters.
- PR titles carry the Linear key, for example `NSI-412`, per the team playbook working rules.
- A handoff between lanes is a new NSI issue in the Bandwise project labeled with the receiving role, in the project of the phase it blocks (the project stands in for the phase label).
- Each project lead is a role. In Linear, set the lead to the person (or agent owner) who runs that role, and keep the role in the project description.

### Where this backlog goes beyond the checklists

Most issues map one to one to a checklist line. These do not:

- **Exit gates.** Each project ends with one "Pass the Phase N exit gate" issue. It is blocked by every open issue in the project that no other project issue waits on, so it waits on the whole project. QA / Evals owns it, except in Phase 0, where the Architect does.
- **Split items.** A checklist line that is larger than 8 points or spans several lanes is split, and each split issue says so in its note: the Phase 0 contract list (P0-09, P0-10), the Phase 0 ADR line (P0-06, P0-18), the Phase 3 parity line (P3-01 to P3-05), the Phase 3 CLI line (P3-22 to P3-24), the Phase 3 Studio line (P3-33, P3-34), and the Phase 3b and 4b lines that name logic, operation, screen and CLI or MCP work in one line (P3b-02 to P3b-05, P3b-21 and P3b-22, P3b-24 to P3b-26, P4b-08 to P4b-10, P4b-11 and P4b-12).
- **Gaps the exit gates need.** P1-19 (`RunSink`), P2-12 (`set.run`, catalog Phase 2) and P2-25 (`usage_daily` rollup). Their phase files have no line for them yet.
- **Decisions and reviews.** P4b-18 and P4b-20 decide the ADR-009 Python and Standalone sections. P2-29, P4b-22 and P6-08 are the Security reviewer's sign-offs for phases that list that role as an owner.
- **Pending phase-file edits.** Other docs agents found these; the backlog already follows the fixed state: the registry sync, alias probe and contract watch jobs are Phase 1 Platform work (P1-20); the same-snapshot regression gate is Phase 3 (P3-02, P3-35), not Phase 3b; approval emails are Phase 3 (P3-17); the adapter picker lands in Phase 5 (P5-03); `escalate_to_llm` is core work from Phase 1 (P1-03), not a Phase 5 plugin action; try-model never writes the draft (P3b-19).

## 2. Projects

| Order | Project | Description | Lead role | Depends on | Issues | Points |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Bandwise P0: Skill and scaffold | Builder skill and plan (done), then the monorepo scaffold, frozen contracts, operation registry skeleton, OpenAPI, ADRs 002 to 010 and CI. | Architect / Lead (`Architect`) | No dependencies. Blocks every other project. | 19 | 61 |
| 2 | Bandwise P1: Core engine and data layer | Core run engine on fixtures, system-one-client, llm-client, the full schema with RLS, repositories, fixtures, the evals CLI and the local CLI. | Core Engine (`Core Engine`) | P0. Needs the Phase 0 contracts (P0-09, P0-10). | 27 | 97 |
| 3 | Bandwise P2: Tenancy, auth, keys and billing | Auth and orgs, BYO keys, app and agent tokens with the device flow, runOperation with approvals and idempotency, the run route, rate limits, the Stripe foundation, platform admin and the console shell. | Platform / Tenancy (`Platform / Tenancy`) | P1. Needs the Phase 1 schema and repositories, and ADR-002 (P0-18). | 30 | 112 |
| 4 | Bandwise P3: Console and management API | Console screens on operations, the management API with parity, the bandwise CLI, MCP stdio, event feed, feedback API, audit sampling, rollout gates and auto-demote, model pages and reports. | Console UI (`Console UI`) | P2. Needs Phase 2 (auth, tokens, runOperation, approvals, the run route). | 45 | 183 |
| 5 | Bandwise P3b: Effectiveness loop | Policy replay and threshold suggestions, set health, proposals, champion/challenger, model upgrades, Studio improve mode and quality-adjusted value. | Quality / Learning (`Quality / Learning`) | P3. Starts when Phase 3 lands. Runs in parallel with P4 and P4b. | 31 | 102 |
| 6 | Bandwise P4: Embed kit | @bandwise/client (edge-safe, typed run, feedback), @bandwise/react, integration recipes and the example app. | Embed Kit (`Embed Kit`) | P3. Can start during Phase 3 against the MSW mocks (P3-26); the exit gate needs the real Phase 3 API. Runs in parallel with P3b and P4b. | 10 | 32 |
| 7 | Bandwise P4b: Integrate and deploy | Opportunities, TypeScript codegen, app bindings, bandwise init, codegen and check, and the interface-breaking guard. Python and the standalone export stay behind ADR-009. | Integrations (`Integrations`) | P3. Starts when Phase 3 lands and runs in parallel with P3b and P4. The TypeScript target builds against the @bandwise/client types (P4-01) until that package lands. | 23 | 69 |
| 8 | Bandwise P5: Plugins and templates | Plugin SDK, built-in adapters and actions, the remaining templates, plugin enablement, org event webhooks and the GitHub Action. | Extensions (`Extensions`) | P4. Needs Phase 4. The GitHub Action also needs bandwise check from P4b. | 11 | 41 |
| 9 | Bandwise P6: Chrome extension | WXT MV3 extension with evaluate page and action picker modes, signed in with the device flow. | Extensions (`Extensions`) | P5. Needs the Phase 5 web page adapter. Runs in parallel with P7. | 9 | 30 |
| 10 | Bandwise P7: MCP HTTP and Claude Code plugin | MCP HTTP transport, the Claude Code plugin with the bandwise-operator and bandwise-integrate skills, and a marketplace entry. | Integrations (`Integrations`) | P3, P3b, P4b. Needs the Phase 3 operations and Phase 4b; the Phase 3b tools must exist. Runs in parallel with P6. | 6 | 18 |

Order of work: P0, then P1, then P2, then P3. When P3 lands, P3b, P4 and P4b run in parallel. P5 follows P4. P6 and P7 run in parallel at the end.

## 3. Issues by project

### Bandwise P0: Skill and scaffold

Builder skill and plan (done), then the monorepo scaffold, frozen contracts, operation registry skeleton, OpenAPI, ADRs 002 to 010 and CI.

Lead role: Architect / Lead. No dependencies. Blocks every other project. Checklist: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-0.md`. 19 issues, 61 points.

P0-01 to P0-05 are Phase 0 part one and are done. P0-06 to P0-19 are Phase 0 part two, the first build.

#### P0-01 Write the bandwise-builder skill and its references

Labels: `Architect` `bandwise:docs` | Estimate: 5 | State: Done | Blocked by: none

The builder skill and every reference exist, so each agent works from one rulebook.

Acceptance criteria:

- `SKILL.md` stays under 300 lines and indexes every reference and phase file.
- References cover architecture, contracts, the run and management APIs, data model, security, testing, phases and the team playbook.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/SKILL.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/team-playbook.md`

#### P0-02 Write the root CLAUDE.md and README.md

Labels: `Architect` `bandwise:docs` | Estimate: 2 | State: Done | Blocked by: none

Anyone opening the repo knows to load the skill and how the product works.

Acceptance criteria:

- `CLAUDE.md` tells agents to load the skill and lists commands, golden rules, env vars and writing rules.
- `README.md` describes the product for a new reader.

Refs: `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`

#### P0-03 Write docs/PLAN.md and ADR-001

Labels: `Architect` `bandwise:docs` `bandwise:adr` | Estimate: 3 | State: Done | Blocked by: none

The plan and the stack decision are on record.

Acceptance criteria:

- `docs/PLAN.md` covers why, scope, phases and team kickoff prompts.
- ADR-001 records the stack. The auth library it left open is settled by ADR-002: Better Auth.

Refs: `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/adr/001-stack.md#open-question-for-adr-002`

#### P0-04 Draft ADRs 007 to 010 with status proposed

Labels: `Architect` `bandwise:adr` `bandwise:headless` `bandwise:models` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 5 | State: Done | Blocked by: none

The four decisions behind Nick's 2026-09-26 requirements are drafted before the contract freeze.

Acceptance criteria:

- ADR-007 headless parity, ADR-008 model registry and neutral naming, ADR-009 app integration and deploy targets, and ADR-010 rollout on pointers and the effectiveness loop exist with status proposed.

Refs: `docs/adr/007-headless-parity.md`, `docs/adr/008-system-one-model-registry.md`, `docs/adr/009-app-integration-and-deploy-targets.md`, `docs/adr/010-rollout-pointers-and-effectiveness-loop.md`

#### P0-05 Add templates: example question set, ADR and plugin

Labels: `Architect` `bandwise:docs` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 2 | State: Done | Blocked by: none

Agents copy from working templates instead of guessing shapes.

Acceptance criteria:

- `templates/question-set.example.json`, `templates/adr.md` and `templates/plugin.template.ts` exist.
- The example spec has no `rollout` key.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/templates/question-set.example.json`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/templates/adr.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/templates/plugin.template.ts`

#### P0-06 Review and accept ADRs 007 to 010 before the contract freeze

Labels: `Architect` `bandwise:adr` `bandwise:contract` `bandwise:headless` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 3 | State: Todo | Blocked by: P0-04

Nick reviews and accepts ADRs 007 to 010, so the Phase 0 contracts freeze on accepted decisions.

Acceptance criteria:

- ADRs 007, 008, 009 and 010 have status accepted.
- The ADR-009 Python and Standalone sections stay proposed (decided later in P4b-18 and P4b-20).
- ADR-001's Amended-by line no longer says ADR-008 and ADR-009 are proposed.
- Every contract name the ADRs use matches the reference files.

Refs: `docs/adr/007-headless-parity.md`, `docs/adr/008-system-one-model-registry.md`, `docs/adr/009-app-integration-and-deploy-targets.md`, `docs/adr/010-rollout-pointers-and-effectiveness-loop.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-0.md#part-two-scaffold-and-contracts`

Note: Split from the phase-0.md ADR item (P0-06, P0-18): ADRs 007 to 010 must be accepted before the contracts freeze, and ADR-002 must be decided before Phase 2 starts.

#### P0-07 Scaffold the pnpm workspace and turborepo with empty packages

Labels: `Architect` | Estimate: 3 | State: Todo | Blocked by: none

Create the monorepo layout every role builds in.

Acceptance criteria:

- A pnpm workspace and `turbo.json` hold every app and package listed in architecture.md, each with a `package.json` and an empty `src`.
- `pnpm i && pnpm turbo lint typecheck test build` passes on the empty scaffold.
- No package name, path or code identifier says jev; model ids such as `jev-1.13.0` are data. The client package is `packages/system-one-client` (ADR-008).

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#packages-and-boundaries`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/conventions.md#naming`

#### P0-08 Add packages/config with strict tsconfig, boundary lint and vitest

Labels: `Architect` `Security` | Estimate: 3 | State: Todo | Blocked by: P0-07

Shared config makes the import boundaries a CI failure, not a review comment.

Acceptance criteria:

- `tsconfig` is strict. A shared vitest preset is used by every package.
- `eslint-plugin-boundaries` encodes every rule in architecture.md: only `system-one-client` imports `@typesafe-ai/sdk`, only `llm-client` imports `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, only `db` imports `drizzle-orm`, only `tenancy` touches crypto and KMS, `react` never imports server code, `core` has no side effects, `codegen` imports only core contracts, and `mcp-server` calls `/api/v1` over HTTP only.
- The `packages/cli/src/local/**` exception is encoded: it may import `core` and the fixture subpath export of `system-one-client`, never the SDK transport.
- A fixture with a deliberate bad import fails lint, and a fixture for the `cli/src/local` exception passes.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#packages-and-boundaries`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/conventions.md#typescript`

#### P0-09 Write the spec, policy, run and error contracts in zod

Labels: `Architect` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 8 | State: Todo | Blocked by: P0-06, P0-07

Freeze the contracts that Phase 1 builds against.

Acceptance criteria:

- In `packages/core/src/contracts`, as zod: `QuestionSetSpec` (strict, no `rollout`), `TenantContext` (with the agent actor), `Channel`, `RolloutStage`, `PublishCtx`; `ConfidencePolicy` (discriminated union), `BandActions`, `ActionRef`; `RunRequest`, `RunDryRunResult`, `SystemOneRequest`, `SystemOneAnswer`, `SystemOneResponse`, `QuestionTypeModule`, `Condition`, `Check`, `FallbackConfig`, `EscalationConfig`, `SetInterface`; `RunResult`, `Decision`, `RunCost`; the error envelope v2, `ErrorDetail`, `GateResult` and `Manifest`.
- Ports and store interfaces are TypeScript interfaces whose payloads are these zod types.
- `templates/question-set.example.json` parses with the strict `QuestionSetSpec` schema.
- The same spec plus a `rollout` key fails with rule `spec.unknown_key` at path `/rollout`.
- A hand-written `RunResult` sample round-trips: parse, serialize and parse again give an equal value.
- Names are neutral (`systemOne`, `system_one`) per ADR-008.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-0.md#part-two-scaffold-and-contracts`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#core-contracts-packagescoresrccontracts`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#ports`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#store-interfaces`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/confidence-policy.md#policy-shape`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/spec-schema.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/savings-model.md#standard-run-envelope-runresult`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/api.md#error-envelope-v2`

Note: Split from the phase-0.md contracts item (P0-09, P0-10), because it is larger than 8 points.

#### P0-10 Write the management, model, deploy, loop and event contracts

Labels: `Architect` `bandwise:contract` `bandwise:headless` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 5 | State: Todo | Blocked by: P0-06, P0-07

Freeze the contracts that the headless surface, the model registry, deploy and the effectiveness loop share.

Acceptance criteria:

- As zod: `OperationDef` and `DryRunResult` (management-api.md), `SpecDiff` (phase-0.md), `ModelProfile` (system-one-models.md), `DeployTarget` and `Opportunity` (deploy-and-codegen.md), `FeedbackReport`, `QualityTarget`, `SetHealth`, `ThresholdProposal` and `LabelingPolicy` (effectiveness-loop.md), and `EventEnvelope` plus `EventType` as the union of the event catalog (events.md).
- `QualityTarget` has one definition, the one in effectiveness-loop.md that architecture.md's contract table points to.
- Each contract has a parse test with one valid and one invalid sample.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#operation-registry`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#dry-runs`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-0.md#specdiff`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-models.md#3-modelprofile-contract`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#4-deploy-targets`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#opportunity-contract`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#5-quality-targets-and-gates-phase-3`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/events.md#eventenvelope`

Note: Split from the phase-0.md contracts item (P0-09, P0-10), because it is larger than 8 points.

#### P0-11 Build the operation registry skeleton with stubbed handlers

Labels: `Architect` `bandwise:headless` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 5 | State: Todo | Blocked by: P0-09, P0-10

Every management operation exists as a registry entry from day one, so OpenAPI and the parity test cover all of them.

Acceptance criteria:

- `apps/console/src/server/operations` holds `OperationDef`, a `runOperation` stub and one entry per operation in the management-api.md catalog, with handlers stubbed.
- Entries whose shape is given have real zod input and output, for example `set.run`, `set.publish`, `eval.run`, `draft.validate`, `job.get` and `version.diff` (output `SpecDiff`).
- Any input with no given shape is `z.object({}).passthrough()` and any such output is `z.unknown()`, each marked `// shape: Phase <n>, owner Platform / Tenancy` from the catalog's Phase column.
- List operations take `limit` and `cursor` and return `{ data, nextCursor }`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-0.md#part-two-scaffold-and-contracts`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#catalog`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#operation-registry`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#conventions-for-every-route`

#### P0-12 Generate openapi.json from the registry and add the parity skeleton

Labels: `Architect` `bandwise:headless` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 3 | State: Todo | Blocked by: P0-11

One generated OpenAPI file feeds the CLI, the MCP server, MSW mocks and the embed kit.

Acceptance criteria:

- `packages/core/openapi.json` is generated from zod and the registry and committed. Each `operationId` is the operation id, with `x-bandwise-scope`, `x-bandwise-min-role`, `x-bandwise-risk` and `x-bandwise-actors`.
- It has a path for every management operation.
- The parity test skeleton runs in CI and fails when an operation has no path. The device flow (`/auth/`), the JWKS and `openapi.json` itself are the documented exceptions.
- The OpenAPI snapshot test fails when the committed file differs from a fresh generation.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#openapi-and-the-parity-test`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#auth-device-flow`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#layers`

#### P0-13 Seed ModelProfile rows for jev-1.13.0, jev-latest and jev-preview

Labels: `Architect` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 2 | State: Todo | Blocked by: P0-10

Model facts start as data, not constants.

Acceptance criteria:

- `packages/core/src/models/catalog.ts` holds the three rows from the seed table, including `aliasTarget` and `supersedes`.
- Every row parses as `ModelProfile`.
- The alias rows point `aliasTarget` at `jev-1.13.0`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-models.md#13-seed-table`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-models.md#3-modelprofile-contract`

#### P0-14 Add the apps/console placeholder page and src/env.ts

Labels: `Architect` | Estimate: 1 | State: Todo | Blocked by: P0-07

The console app boots and reads env in one place.

Acceptance criteria:

- An App Router placeholder page renders.
- All env access goes through `apps/console/src/env.ts` (t3-env), marked `server-only`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/conventions.md#env`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/conventions.md#nextjs`

#### P0-15 Add .env.example with every documented variable

Labels: `Architect` `Security` | Estimate: 1 | State: Todo | Blocked by: P0-07

Developers and agents see every variable without any secret in git.

Acceptance criteria:

- Lists `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `BANDWISE_KEK`, `BANDWISE_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`, `SYSTEM_ONE_TRANSPORT`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `REDIS_URL` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, with no values.
- No `.env*` file with values is committed.

Refs: `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/conventions.md#env`

#### P0-16 Add GitHub Actions CI for lint, typecheck, test and build

Labels: `Architect` | Estimate: 2 | State: Todo | Blocked by: P0-08

Every PR runs the same gate agents run locally.

Acceptance criteria:

- CI runs `pnpm i` and `pnpm turbo lint typecheck test build` on every PR and fails on any step.
- CI needs no `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` and makes no live System One call.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#layers`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/team-playbook.md#working-rules`

#### P0-17 Add the PR template with contract, tenancy and security sections

Labels: `Architect` `bandwise:docs` | Estimate: 1 | State: Todo | Blocked by: none

Every PR states its contract, tenancy and security impact.

Acceptance criteria:

- The template has Summary, Phase and checklist item, Contract impact, Tenancy impact, Security impact, Tests added and Docs updated.
- It asks for the Linear issue key (for example `NSI-412`) in the PR title.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/team-playbook.md#pr-template-sections`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/team-playbook.md#working-rules`

#### P0-18 Draft and decide ADRs 002 to 006

Labels: `Architect` `bandwise:adr` `Security` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 5 | State: Todo | Blocked by: none

Record the open infrastructure decisions before the phases that need them.

Acceptance criteria:

- ADR-002 picks the auth library: Better Auth with the organization, admin and two-factor plugins (accepted by Nick, 2026-09-26). It supports many orgs per user, invites, five roles and audited impersonation.
- ADR-003 key vault, ADR-004 cache, ADR-005 jobs runner and ADR-006 billing model are written from `templates/adr.md` and saved in `docs/adr/` with a status line.

Refs: `docs/adr/001-stack.md#open-question-for-adr-002`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/templates/adr.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#typesafe-keys`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#caching`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#background-jobs`

Note: Split from the phase-0.md ADR item (P0-06, P0-18): ADRs 007 to 010 must be accepted before the contracts freeze, and ADR-002 must be decided before Phase 2 starts.

#### P0-19 Pass the Phase 0 exit gate

Labels: `Architect` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 2 | State: Todo | Blocked by: P0-12, P0-13, P0-14, P0-15, P0-16, P0-17, P0-18

Confirm Phase 0 is done before Phase 1 starts.

Acceptance criteria:

- `pnpm i && pnpm turbo lint typecheck test build` passes on the scaffold.
- Boundary lint catches a deliberate bad import in a test fixture.
- `openapi.json` has a path for every management operation, and the parity test skeleton runs.
- The example spec parses as strict `QuestionSetSpec`. Adding a `rollout` key fails with rule `spec.unknown_key` at `/rollout`.
- Every row in `catalog.ts` parses as `ModelProfile`. A sample `RunResult` round-trips through its zod schema.
- ADRs 007 to 010 are accepted. Only the ADR-009 Python and Standalone sections stay proposed.
- Fresh-agent checks pass: "add a question set feature" names spec-schema.md, architecture.md and phases/phase-3.md; "let an agent publish a set" names management-api.md, security.md and headless-and-agents.md; "add a new System One model" names system-one-models.md.

### Bandwise P1: Core engine and data layer

Core run engine on fixtures, system-one-client, llm-client, the full schema with RLS, repositories, fixtures, the evals CLI and the local CLI.

Lead role: Core Engine. Depends on: Bandwise P0: Skill and scaffold. Needs the Phase 0 contracts (P0-09, P0-10). Checklist: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-1.md`. 27 issues, 97 points.

#### P1-01 Build the spec compiler with noul, choice and score modules

Labels: `Core Engine` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-09

Each spec stage compiles to a System One request through one module per question type.

Acceptance criteria:

- Each `QuestionSetSpec` stage compiles to a `SystemOneRequest` through the `QuestionTypeModule` files in `packages/core/src/question-types`.
- No per-type logic lives outside `question-types`, so a new type is one module plus a renderer.
- An answer of unknown type is stored raw with warning `unknown_answer_type`, band `low` and `effectiveAction` `fallback`, and never throws.
- 100 percent branch coverage.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/spec-schema.md#9-questiontypemodule-and-systemoneanswer`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-api-contract.md#request`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-api-contract.md#question-types`

#### P1-02 Build the stage orchestrator: checks, when, stateFrom and batch split

Labels: `Core Engine` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-01

Runs execute stages in order with pure checks and merged state.

Acceptance criteria:

- Evaluates `spec.checks` with no System One call and skips a stage whose `when` fails.
- Merges `answers.<qid> = { value, band }` per `stateFrom`.
- Splits a stage into parallel batches when it exceeds the profile limits.
- A question in a skipped stage has no `answers` entry and gets the skipped decision shape in testing.md.
- `runQuestionSet` runs end to end with a fixture transport and in-memory stores.

#### P1-03 Build the confidence router per the normative table

Labels: `Core Engine` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 8 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-09

Bands, actions and effective actions follow the one normative table, enforced only in core.

Acceptance criteria:

- Covers per-option overrides, noul bands, relevance (`relevantWhen`), composites (level and band), routes (first match wins, then `defaultRoute`), run band and `overallAction` with the order `review > fallback > escalate_to_llm > auto`.
- `effectiveAction` follows the stage by band by action table on production and staging. Staging dispatches no side-effect handler unless `dispatchActionsOnStaging`. `Decision.executed` follows its rule.
- `escalate_to_llm` calls `ports.llm` in run step 10. `Decision.value` keeps the System One answer and the LLM result goes in `Decision.escalation`. A missing port, a failure or a timeout gives `effectiveAction` `review` and warning `escalation_failed`.
- Table-driven tests: one row per normative table row, band edges for every type, relevance, skipped and empty decisions, composites and conservative ordering. 100 percent branch coverage.

#### P1-04 Implement cost and savings math for all three kinds

Labels: `Core Engine` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-09

Every run reports honest cost and savings in integer micro-USD.

Acceptance criteria:

- Money math uses integer micro-USD and one `round_half_up` per term. Test vector: 318 input tokens on `jev-1.13.0` at 42,000 micro-USD per Mtok cost 13 micro-USD.
- Each call is priced by its own `modelResolved`. Calls that resolve to different models set warning `model_resolved_mixed`.
- Decision counterfactual, escalation avoided and context pruned are computed. Only decisions with `effectiveAction` `auto` count toward savings. Shadow, eval, staging and experiment runs report `savingsUsd` 0 with a `savingsSuppressed` reason.
- An unpriced model gives cost `null` and warning `model_unpriced` in BYO key mode.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/savings-model.md#money-math`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/savings-model.md#the-three-kinds-of-savings`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/savings-model.md#honesty-rules`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#cost-and-savings-tests`

#### P1-05 Add token preflight from ModelProfile limits

Labels: `Core Engine` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-09, P0-13

Oversized requests fail fast, with limits read from the model profile.

Acceptance criteria:

- Limits come from the profile (`statePlusLongestQuestionTokens`, `requestTokens`), never constants. A moving name uses the profile of its last observed resolved model.
- Warns at 80 percent and fails fast with `preflight_too_large`.
- A fake 16k profile blocks a 20k state, and the `jev-1.13.0` profile lets the same state through.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-models.md#7-limits-as-data`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#run-data-flow`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#model-registry-tests`

#### P1-06 Implement lints with stable rule ids, including model and weakness lints

Labels: `Core Engine` `bandwise:models` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-09, P0-13

Specs get the same pure lint results in the editor and at publish.

Acceptance criteria:

- `lint(spec, profile, publishCtx?)` returns `{ rule, severity, path, message }` with `path` as a JSON Pointer, for every rule in the lint and weakness tables.
- Lints that need a `PublishCtx` field are skipped when it is absent.
- Each model lint fires on a minimal bad spec and stays quiet on a clean one. Weakness lints fire only when the profile lists the weakness.
- `templates/question-set.example.json` lints with zero errors against the `jev-1.13.0` seed profile.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#lints-packagescoresrclints`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#model-weakness-lints`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-models.md#10-weaknesses`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#model-registry-tests`

#### P1-07 Implement interfaceOf and diffInterface

Labels: `Core Engine` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-09

Interface changes between versions are computed, so breaking changes fail loudly later.

Acceptance criteria:

- `interfaceOf(spec)` returns a `SetInterface`.
- `diffInterface(from, to)` returns `{ breaking, additive }`, with a table test for each change type in spec-schema.md section 11.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/spec-schema.md#11-setinterface`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#5-set-interface-and-compatibility`

#### P1-08 Write the authz.ts role matrix

Labels: `Core Engine` `Security` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-09

One `can()` decides every permission for every caller.

Acceptance criteria:

- `can(ctx, action, resource)` in `packages/core/src/authz.ts` covers the five roles, scopes and resource rules such as protected sets needing an admin to publish.
- For agent tokens the effective role is min(role ceiling, membership role), and both scope and role are required.
- A table test covers each role and scope.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#roles`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#authorization`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#agent-tokens`

#### P1-09 Build system-one-client with SDK and fixture transports

Labels: `Core Engine` `bandwise:models` `Security` | Estimate: 8 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-09

One package owns every System One call, its errors and its fixtures.

Acceptance criteria:

- `SdkTransport` is the only importer of `@typesafe-ai/sdk`. Every client has an explicit `baseURL`, `defaultModel`, `logLevel: 'warn'` and a scrubbing logger.
- Errors map to `system_one_*` codes, and every row of the errors table has a unit test, including 400, 403, 404, 408, `APIUserAbortError` and a timeout.
- Per-surface timeouts and retry budgets configure the SDK's own retries, with no second retry loop. Request ids are captured. Clients are cached per org.
- Model list and alias probe helpers exist.
- `FixtureTransport` ships as its own subpath export that never imports `@typesafe-ai/sdk`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-api-contract.md#errors`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-api-contract.md#js-sdk-usage`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#latency-budgets`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#typesafe-keys`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#fixtures`

#### P1-10 Build llm-client with the LlmTransport port and a fixture transport

Labels: `Core Engine` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-09

Studio drafting, improve mode, opportunity drafting and escalation share one metered LLM port.

Acceptance criteria:

- `llm-client` is the only importer of `@anthropic-ai/sdk`.
- `LlmTransport.complete` matches architecture.md and returns model and token counts for metering.
- A fixture transport serves tests. Model ids come from the claude-api skill, not guesses.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#ports`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#packages-and-boundaries`

#### P1-11 Build bandwise run --local in packages/cli/src/local

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-02, P1-03, P1-09, P0-08

A developer runs a spec locally with no network and no key.

Acceptance criteria:

- `pnpm bandwise run --local spec.json state.json` runs `templates/question-set.example.json` on the fixture transport, with no network access and no `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`.
- The code lives in `packages/cli/src/local/**`, imports only `core` and the fixture subpath of `system-one-client`, and loads through a dynamic import.
- The boundary lint rejects a deliberate import of the SDK transport from `packages/cli/src/local/**`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-1.md#integrations`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#packages-and-boundaries`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#datasets-evals-and-runs`

#### P1-12 Write the full Drizzle schema with RLS in migration 0001

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:tenancy` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 8 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-09

Tenancy is in the schema from the first migration.

Acceptance criteria:

- Every table in data-model.md exists, with `org_id`, an RLS policy from the template and an `org_id` index on every tenant table, in migration 0001.
- The platform tables `system_one_models` (seeded from `catalog.ts`) and `model_alias_observations` have no `org_id`.
- Money columns are integer micro-USD. Rollout exists only on `release_pointers`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#tables`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#rls-policy-template`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#platform-tables-no-org_id`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#migrations`

#### P1-13 Implement withTenant with transaction-local set_config

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-12

Every query runs inside one tenant context.

Acceptance criteria:

- `withTenant(ctx, fn)` opens a transaction and sets `app.org_id` transaction-locally.
- All DB access goes through it.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#tenancy-rules`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#rls-policy-template`

#### P1-14 Add the RLS setting test for app.org_id

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:tenancy` `Security` | Estimate: 1 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-12, P1-13

A wrong RLS setting name fails CI.

Acceptance criteria:

- A schema scan fails on any policy or `withTenant` call that uses a setting name other than `app.org_id`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#security-tests`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#rls-policy-template`

#### P1-15 Add repositories for every table with no raw db export

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-13

All data access goes through tenant-scoped repositories.

Acceptance criteria:

- One repository per table. `packages/db` exports no raw `db` handle.
- Every repository method runs inside `withTenant`.
- Adding a repository without adding it to the cross-tenant suite fails CI.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#migrations`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#cross-tenant-suite`

#### P1-16 Add the immutability trigger on published versions

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` | Estimate: 1 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-12

Published versions can never change.

Acceptance criteria:

- A DB trigger rejects any update to a published version's spec, and a test proves it.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#invariants-tested`

#### P1-17 Add the two-org seed

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-15

Tests start from two orgs with real-looking data.

Acceptance criteria:

- A seed creates two orgs, each with members, a goal, a set and runs.
- The cross-tenant suite and Playwright use it.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#identity-and-tenancy`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#cross-tenant-suite`

#### P1-18 Add dev implementations: local KEK vault, in-memory limiter and quota

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `Security` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-09

Everyone can run the stack locally with no cloud services.

Acceptance criteria:

- A `KeyResolver` backed by a `BANDWISE_KEK` envelope vault for dev, with an encrypt and decrypt round-trip test.
- In-memory `RateLimiter` and `QuotaGuard` match the port signatures.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#ports`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#typesafe-keys`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#security-tests`

#### P1-19 Implement RunSink over the repositories

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:tenancy` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-15

A run and everything it creates are written in one transaction.

Acceptance criteria:

- `RunSink.persist` writes the run, action review items, usage events with the resolved model and the `model_alias_observations` update in one transaction. Label items join once the audit sampler lands (P3-30).
- A new `model_requested` to `model_resolved` pair emits `model.alias_moved` once.
- Usage events exist for every successful run.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#ports`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#run-data-flow`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#runs-partitioned-by-month`

Note: Added: phase-1.md has no line for RunSink, but the Phase 1 exit gate needs usage events for every run.

#### P1-20 Run the registry sync, alias probe and contract watch jobs

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-09, P1-15, P1-18

New models, moved aliases and TypeSafe contract changes are detected from Phase 1.

Acceptance criteria:

- Registry sync (nightly) lists `/v1/models` per org key, stores the reachable names in `org_typesafe_keys.models`, inserts unseen names as `unreviewed` and alerts the platform admin. An unseen `foo-2.0.0` is covered by a test.
- The alias probe sends a one-noul request for idle aliases and records the response `model`.
- Contract watch (nightly) diffs TypeSafe's `openapi.json`, `llms.txt` and `models.md` against committed snapshots, then alerts and opens an issue for the Architect on a change.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#background-jobs`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-models.md#6-detection`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#model-registry-tests`

Note: phase-3.md says these jobs run from Phase 1. The matching Platform line in phase-1.md is a pending edit.

#### P1-21 Record the minimum fixture set, including an alias-resolved response

Labels: `QA / Evals` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-09

Tests run on recorded System One responses, never live calls.

Acceptance criteria:

- Fixtures live in `packages/system-one-client/fixtures/*.json` as `{ request, response, openapiVersion }`.
- The set covers one of each question type, a multi-stage run, a choice with a none option chosen, a noul near 0.5, `jev-latest` answered by `jev-1.13.0`, and 401, 422, 429 and 529 errors.
- `pnpm fixtures:record [--model <id>]` re-records and scrubs headers and ids.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#fixtures`

#### P1-22 Add the fixture contract test against zod

Labels: `QA / Evals` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-21

A changed System One shape fails CI, and new fields pass.

Acceptance criteria:

- Every fixture response validates against the passthrough answer schemas.
- The test fails when the committed contract snapshot's `openapi.json` version is newer than the fixtures' version. PR CI needs no network.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#fixtures`

#### P1-23 Add the pinned-classification table test

Labels: `QA / Evals` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 1 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-13

Pinned versus moving comes from the registry only.

Acceptance criteria:

- `jev-latest`, `jev-preview`, `jev` and `jev-1.13` are moving, `jev-1.13.0` is pinned, and an unseen `foo-2.0.0` is moving.
- Classification reads the registry `kind` only, never a pattern match.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#model-registry-tests`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-models.md#4-pinned-or-moving`

#### P1-24 Build the packages/evals CLI

Labels: `QA / Evals` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-02, P1-03, P1-04, P1-15

Internal evals score a version on a dataset with the metrics the gates use.

Acceptance criteria:

- `pnpm eval --org <slug> --set <slug> --version <n> --dataset <name> [--snapshot <id>] [--model <id>]` runs. Without `--snapshot` it takes a new snapshot.
- Metrics per question (accuracy, MAE, Brier, confusion matrix) and per band (precision with its 95 percent Wilson lower bound, coverage, review load, ECE), plus cost and latency.
- `eval_runs` record `model` and `snapshot_id`. `--model` evaluates without publishing.
- `--repeats` and the stability metric land in P3b-27.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#evals-packagesevals`

#### P1-25 Build the cross-tenant suite generator

Labels: `QA / Evals` `bandwise:tenancy` `Security` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-15, P1-17

Tenant isolation is tested for every repository method, automatically.

Acceptance criteria:

- Generated from the repository list: with org A's context, a method cannot read or write org B's rows.
- With the repository's org filter bypassed, RLS alone returns zero rows.
- Route checks (org B's token on an org A resource returns 404) are added as routes land.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#cross-tenant-suite`

#### P1-26 Add the live smoke script for the smoke list models

Labels: `QA / Evals` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-09

Nightly smoke catches live System One changes the fixtures cannot.

Acceptance criteria:

- `pnpm smoke` is skipped without `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`. `--model <id>` runs one model.
- The smoke list is `jev-preview`, `jev-latest`, each pinned version in use and every registry model with status `preview` or `stable`.
- Per model: one call per question type in the profile and one two-stage run. Asserts the response shape, `usage.input_tokens > 0`, a versioned id in the response `model`, and total cost under $0.001.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#live-smoke-pnpm-smoke`

#### P1-27 Pass the Phase 1 exit gate

Labels: `QA / Evals` `bandwise:tenancy` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-05, P1-06, P1-07, P1-08, P1-10, P1-11, P1-14, P1-16, P1-19, P1-20, P1-22, P1-23, P1-24, P1-25, P1-26

Confirm Phase 1 is done before Phase 2 starts.

Acceptance criteria:

- A spec runs end to end against fixtures and returns a valid `RunResult` with bands, actions, cost and savings.
- Router and compiler at 100 percent branch coverage.
- Usage events are written for every run, each with the resolved model.
- The cross-tenant suite passes, including with the repository filter bypassed.
- `pnpm smoke` passes when `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is set.
- Preflight limits come from the profile: a fake 16k profile blocks a 20k state.
- An unknown answer type is stored raw and never throws.
- `templates/question-set.example.json` lints with zero errors against the `jev-1.13.0` seed profile.
- `pnpm bandwise run --local` runs the demo spec with no network access and no `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`.
- The boundary lint rejects a deliberate import of the SDK transport from `packages/cli/src/local/**`.

### Bandwise P2: Tenancy, auth, keys and billing

Auth and orgs, BYO keys, app and agent tokens with the device flow, runOperation with approvals and idempotency, the run route, rate limits, the Stripe foundation, platform admin and the console shell.

Lead role: Platform / Tenancy. Depends on: Bandwise P1: Core engine and data layer. Needs the Phase 1 schema and repositories, and ADR-002 (P0-18). Checklist: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-2.md`. 30 issues, 112 points.

#### P2-01 Wire auth per ADR-002: orgs, memberships, invites, roles, active org

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:tenancy` `Security` | Estimate: 8 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-18, P1-15

People sign in, belong to many orgs, and act in one active org at a time.

Acceptance criteria:

- The ADR-002 library signs users in. `organizations` and `memberships` hold five roles. Invites are 7-day token links. One user can hold many orgs and picks the active org.
- `org.create` (session only) makes the caller the owner.
- `member.list`, `member.invite`, `member.role_change` and `member.remove` exist as operations. Invites and removals count as role changes. Changing a member to or from owner needs the owner role.

#### P2-02 Add the org switcher and /[orgSlug] routing

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-01

Every tenant page is scoped by its org slug.

Acceptance criteria:

- Every tenant page lives under `/[orgSlug]`, and switching org switches the tenant context.
- A user in three orgs sees no data from the other two (Playwright, SGR, Personal and Dallas style seed).

#### P2-03 Build the BYO key vault with envelope encryption and validation

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `Security` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-18, P1-09, P2-01

Org TypeSafe keys are stored encrypted and never leave the server.

Acceptance criteria:

- A per-org DEK (AES-256-GCM) is wrapped by KMS in production and `BANDWISE_KEK` in dev. Only `tenancy.KeyResolver` decrypts, plaintext is cached for at most 5 minutes, and the UI shows `key_last4` and a fingerprint only.
- Saving validates the key with `GET /v1/models` and stores the reachable names in `org_typesafe_keys.models`.
- `key.get`, `key.rotate` (also saves the first key) and `key.revoke` exist as operations. A 401 from TypeSafe marks the key invalid and emits `key.invalid`.
- KEK rotation re-wraps DEKs in a background job.

#### P2-04 Add platform key mode

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `Security` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-03

Orgs without their own key can run on the platform key, metered and capped.

Acceptance criteria:

- An org can run on the platform TypeSafe key. Usage is metered to its Stripe subscription and capped by plan.
- An unpriced model returns `422 model_unpriced` in platform key mode.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#typesafe-keys`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#model-registry-tests`

#### P2-05 Add app tokens: sk_live_, sk_test_ and pk_live_

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `Security` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-01

Host apps call Bandwise with scoped, channel-bound tokens.

Acceptance criteria:

- Create (shown once, stored as sha256 with a pepper), scopes, set allowlist, origins, channel binding (production by default), expiry, revoke and `last_used_at`.
- `runs:write` and `feedback:write` exist only on `sk_` tokens. `pk_` tokens are run-only with an origin check.
- `app.list`, `app.create`, `app.update`, `app_token.create` and `app_token.revoke` exist as operations (admin). A token with a write scope is `high*` for agents, except `feedback:write` on an `sk_test_` token bound to staging.
- Revocation takes effect within 60 seconds.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#app-tokens`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#apps-and-integration`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#keys-and-agent-tokens`

#### P2-06 Add agent tokens (sa_live_) with role ceiling, scopes and expiry

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `Security` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-01

Agents act for one user in one org and never above that user's role.

Acceptance criteria:

- Created in settings with scopes from the final scope list, a role ceiling, a 90-day maximum expiry and an optional daily spend cap (`402 token_budget_exceeded`).
- Effective role is min(ceiling, current membership role), read on every request. Demoting the user removes the permission on the next request.
- A token mints only tokens with scopes it holds and never `admin:write`. A token can always revoke itself.
- `agent_token.list`, `agent_token.create`, `agent_token.revoke` and `actor.get` exist as operations.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#agent-tokens`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#identity-tokens-and-admin`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#keys-and-agent-tokens`

#### P2-07 Build the device flow for agent tokens (RFC 8628)

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `Security` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-06

The CLI, MCP server and Chrome extension get agent tokens without copying secrets.

Acceptance criteria:

- `POST /api/v1/auth/device/code` and `POST /api/v1/auth/device/token` are plain route handlers.
- The person approves in a console session and picks the org, scopes and a ceiling no higher than their own role.
- Codes are single use and expire after 10 minutes. The token records its client (cli, mcp or extension).

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#agent-tokens`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#auth-device-flow`

#### P2-08 Implement runOperation steps: actor, validation, can() and If-Match

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` `Security` | Estimate: 8 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-11, P1-08, P2-06

Every caller goes through the same operation pipeline.

Acceptance criteria:

- The runOperation steps run in the documented order: `400 invalid_request` with `details`, `403 insufficient_scope` in the caller's org, `404` across orgs or outside the set allowlist. Session-only operations refuse tokens.
- `If-Match`: `428` when missing, `412 precondition_failed` with `currentEtag` on mismatch.
- Dry runs run steps 1 to 6 and `op.preview`, and write nothing.
- Events for `op.emits` are written in the same transaction.
- Server Actions and generated route handlers are thin adapters over `runOperation`.

#### P2-09 Add approval_requests and the approval step in runOperation

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` `Security` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-08

High-risk agent operations wait for a person.

Acceptance criteria:

- A high-risk agent call returns `202 { approval: { id, status, url, expiresAt } }`, stores the input, `input_hash` and `If-Match`, and emits `approval.requested`. A repeat call for the same operation and `input_hash` returns the same request.
- `approval.list`, `approval.get` and `approval.decide` (session only) exist as operations. An approved request runs its stored input unchanged with `approval_id`. A changed draft fails with 412 and nothing publishes.
- Requests expire after 7 days. Moves toward safety are never gated.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#approvals`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#approval-gate`

#### P2-10 Add the agentApprovals org setting and the always-gated list

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `Security` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-09

Orgs choose how much agents may do without a person, within fixed limits.

Acceptance criteria:

- Values `required` (default), `production_only` and `off`.
- Always gated whatever the setting: key rotation or revocation, member role changes, PII and retention changes, org deletion, `admin:write` token creation and lowering `agentApprovals`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#approval-gate`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#catalog`

#### P2-11 Add idempotency middleware on idempotency_keys

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-08

Retries from apps and agents never apply twice.

Acceptance criteria:

- `Idempotency-Key` is required on mutations from app and agent tokens (`400` when missing). Runs and feedback are the documented exceptions.
- Keys live 24 hours and are written in the operation's transaction. A replay returns the stored response with `Idempotent-Replayed: true`.
- The same key with a different body returns `422 idempotency_key_reused`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#idempotency-keys`

#### P2-12 Serve runs through set.run on POST /api/v1/sets/{ref}/run

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:tenancy` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-05, P2-08, P1-02, P1-03, P1-19

Apps, agents and the console run sets through one operation.

Acceptance criteria:

- `set.run` takes a `RunRequest` and returns `RunResult`, or `RunDryRunResult` when `options.dryRun` is set, following the run data flow. Sessions, agent tokens and app tokens (on their bound channel) may call it.
- `slug@7` pins a version. `slug@draft` behaves as shadow and is refused for `sk_live_` and `pk_live_`. An `inactive` channel returns `409 set_not_live`.
- `Idempotency-Key` is accepted. A replay returns the original `runId` with no second action or usage event.
- Responses carry `ETag`, `X-Request-Id`, `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/api.md#endpoints-run-surface`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#runs-and-usage`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#run-data-flow`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/spec-schema.md#1-runrequest`

Note: Added: the catalog puts `set.run` in Phase 2, and the k6 exit checks need it, but phase-2.md has no line for it.

#### P2-13 Add browser token minting with ES256 and the JWKS route

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `Security` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-05

Browsers get short-lived tokens without ever holding an `sk_` token.

Acceptance criteria:

- `POST /api/v1/tokens/browser` (`browser_token.create`, `sk_` only) returns a 5-minute ES256 JWT bound to origin and set list, signed with `BANDWISE_JWT_SIGNING_KEY` and a `kid`.
- The JWKS is served at `/api/v1/.well-known/jwks.json`. On rotation the new `kid` is published before it signs, and the old one stays until its tokens expire.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#app-tokens`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/api.md#auth-modes`

#### P2-14 Add org_webhook_secrets, encrypted like TypeSafe keys

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `Security` | Estimate: 1 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-03

Org webhook signing secrets exist before Phase 5 webhooks need them.

Acceptance criteria:

- Each org's webhook secret uses the same envelope encryption as `org_typesafe_keys` and is never logged.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#typesafe-keys`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/events.md#org-webhooks-phase-5`

#### P2-15 Split retention into state, answers and dataset settings

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `Security` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-01

State, answers and datasets are kept on separate clocks.

Acceptance criteria:

- `state_retention_days` (default 30), `answers_retention_days` (default 180) and `dataset_retention_days` (defaults to the state retention; only an admin can raise it, audited).
- Retention changes are always gated for agents.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#pii-and-data-handling`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#13-data-for-learning`

#### P2-16 Add rate limiters per org, token, eval bucket and model budget

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:tenancy` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-18, P2-05, P2-06

One noisy org or agent cannot starve another.

Acceptance criteria:

- Limiters per org (plan) and per token, an eval bucket (25 percent of org RPM by default, lowest priority), and a global per-model budget from platform settings (about 1,000 RPM for `jev-1.13.0`) with per-org fair share.
- Limiter keys include the model and are prefixed `org:{orgId}:`.

#### P2-17 Write audit rows inside withTenant for every mutation

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `Security` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-08

Every change says who did it, through what, and who approved it.

Acceptance criteria:

- `audit_log` is append-only: the app's DB role has no UPDATE or DELETE on it.
- Every mutation writes exactly one row with `actor_type`, `client`, `actor_user_id`, `actor_token_id`, `approval_id` and `actor_role`. Impersonation writes `impersonator_id`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#audit`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#invariants-tested`

#### P2-18 Build the platform admin route group with impersonation

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `Security` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-01, P2-17

The platform admin manages orgs and platform settings safely.

Acceptance criteria:

- A separate route group needs `platform_role = 'superadmin'` and MFA. Org tokens get 404.
- `platform_org.list`, `platform_org.suspend` (blocks runs within 30 seconds), `platform_org.set_entitlement`, `platform_settings.get|update` and `platform_price_book.get|update` exist as session-only operations.
- Impersonation is time-boxed, shows a banner and is audited.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#platform-admin`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#platform-platform-admin-only`

#### P2-19 Write plans.ts with plan limits

Labels: `Billing` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-09

Plan limits are one typed source.

Acceptance criteria:

- `plans.ts` sets runs per month, platform System One spend per month, RPM, seats, apps, sets, retention maximum, SSO and eval runs for each `PlanId`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-2.md#billing--savings`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#core-contracts-packagescoresrccontracts`

#### P2-20 Set up Stripe products, meters, Checkout and Customer Portal

Labels: `Billing` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-19, P2-01, P0-18

Orgs subscribe and pay for System One spend.

Acceptance criteria:

- Meters bill System One cost in micro-USD (or one meter per model), never raw tokens at one rate.
- Checkout and the Customer Portal open from a console session. They are the documented console-only exception to headless parity.
- A billing upgrade works in Stripe test mode.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-2.md#billing--savings`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/savings-model.md#price-book`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#playwright`

#### P2-21 Handle Stripe webhooks with idempotency and read-only mode

Labels: `Billing` `Security` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-20

Billing events apply once, and failed payments degrade gracefully.

Acceptance criteria:

- Webhook signatures are verified, with a rejection test.
- An idempotency table makes a replayed webhook a no-op.
- A failed payment starts a grace period, then read-only mode.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-2.md#billing--savings`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#security-tests`

#### P2-22 Build the meter outbox job to Stripe

Labels: `Billing` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-20, P1-19

Usage reaches Stripe exactly once per run.

Acceptance criteria:

- Every minute, the outbox pushes usage events to Stripe with the run id as the idempotency key.
- A replayed run pushes nothing.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#background-jobs`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#idempotency-keys`

#### P2-23 Carry the resolved model on usage events into metering

Labels: `Billing` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 1 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-19

Spend is priced by the model that answered.

Acceptance criteria:

- Usage events carry `model_resolved`, and metering and price lookups use it.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#billing-and-usage`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/savings-model.md#price-book`

#### P2-24 Add price book defaults and per-org overrides by versioned model

Labels: `Billing` `bandwise:models` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-12, P2-18

Prices are data, keyed by the exact versioned model id.

Acceptance criteria:

- Platform default rows (`org_id` null) and org overrides, keyed by exact versioned model id. Alias rows are rejected with 400.
- An org override wins for its own org. `price_book.get` and `price_book.update` exist as operations.
- Cross-tenant test: org A cannot read or write org B's override, and both read the platform rows.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/savings-model.md#price-book`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-models.md#8-pricing`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md#billing-and-usage`

#### P2-25 Build the nightly usage_daily rollup

Labels: `Billing` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-19

Quota, billing reconciliation and dashboards read one daily rollup.

Acceptance criteria:

- `usage_daily` rolls up runs, `system_one_input_tokens` and `system_one_cost_micro_usd` per org, set and model, nightly.
- Stripe test clock: 1,000 runs reconcile with `usage_daily` within 0.1 percent.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/savings-model.md#rollups-usage_daily`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#background-jobs`

Note: Added: the quota guard and the Stripe reconciliation exit check read `usage_daily`, but no phase-2.md line builds it.

#### P2-26 Add the quota guard on usage_daily plus a same-day Redis counter

Labels: `Billing` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-19, P2-25

Plans cap usage without a slow query on every run.

Acceptance criteria:

- `QuotaGuard` reads `usage_daily` plus a same-day Redis counter and returns `quota_exceeded` or `token_budget_exceeded` per the port.
- It is checked in run step 7.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#ports`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#run-data-flow`

#### P2-27 Build the console shell and settings pages

Labels: `Console UI` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-02, P2-08

The console has its frame and the settings every org needs.

Acceptance criteria:

- Layout, org switcher and nav.
- Settings pages for members, keys, apps, agent tokens, billing, retention, PII and agent approvals.
- Every page calls operations, never repositories.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-2.md#console-ui`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#adapters`

#### P2-28 Build the approvals inbox: list, approve and reject

Labels: `Console UI` `bandwise:headless` `Security` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-09, P2-27

People decide pending agent requests in the console.

Acceptance criteria:

- The inbox lists `approval.list` with a count badge.
- Approve or reject goes through `approval.decide` in a console session, and the stored input then runs.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#approvals`

#### P2-29 Review keys, tokens, device flow and approvals for security

Labels: `Security review` `Security` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-03, P2-05, P2-06, P2-07, P2-09, P2-13

The Security reviewer signs off on the Phase 2 attack surface.

Acceptance criteria:

- Each PR touching keys, authz, app or agent tokens, approvals, the device flow or browser tokens has Security reviewer sign-off.
- The log scrubber test finds no `sk_`, `pk_`, `sa_live_` or TypeSafe key material in logs or responses.
- The default `agentApprovals` setting is reviewed, as PLAN.md requires before the first paying customer.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#security-tests`, `docs/PLAN.md#before-the-first-paying-customer`

Note: Added: phase-2.md names the Security reviewer as an owner without a checklist line.

#### P2-30 Pass the Phase 2 exit gate

Labels: `QA / Evals` `bandwise:tenancy` `Security` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-04, P2-10, P2-11, P2-12, P2-14, P2-15, P2-16, P2-21, P2-22, P2-23, P2-24, P2-26, P2-28, P2-29

Confirm Phase 2 is done before Phase 3 starts.

Acceptance criteria:

- One user in three orgs (SGR, Personal, Dallas style seed) switches with no data leak (Playwright).
- One Playwright test per role proves its permissions.
- Demoting a user removes the matching permissions from their agent tokens on the next request.
- An agent token hitting a high-risk operation gets 202 and a pending approval. A person approves in the console and the stored input runs.
- Log scrubber test: no key material (`sk_`, `pk_`, `sa_live_`, TypeSafe keys) in logs or responses.
- k6: one org at its limit does not move another org's p95 latency.
- k6: a 5,000-case eval in org A does not move org A production p95 by more than 10 percent.
- Stripe test clock: subscribe, run 1,000 runs, and invoiced System One spend reconciles with `usage_daily` within 0.1 percent.
- Replaying a webhook is a no-op.

### Bandwise P3: Console and management API

Console screens on operations, the management API with parity, the bandwise CLI, MCP stdio, event feed, feedback API, audit sampling, rollout gates and auto-demote, model pages and reports.

Lead role: Console UI. Depends on: Bandwise P2: Tenancy, auth, keys and billing. Needs Phase 2 (auth, tokens, runOperation, approvals, the run route). Checklist: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-3.md`. 45 issues, 183 points.

#### P3-01 Register project, goal, template, set and draft operations

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-08, P2-11, P1-06

The set-building operations exist before any screen uses them.

Acceptance criteria:

- The Phase 3 rows under Projects and goals and under Sets and drafts have real input and output schemas and handlers.
- The draft ETag is its `spec_hash`. `draft.update` replaces the whole strict spec and requires `If-Match`. A `rollout` key fails with a message naming `rollout.change`.
- `draft.validate` returns `{ errors[], warnings[] }` in the error `details` shape and writes nothing.
- `template.list` returns `{ id, name, pattern, parameters }`. `set.create` without `fromVersion` copies the default model into the draft once.
- `set.update` changes `name`, `protected` (admin only), `labeling`, `dispatchActionsOnStaging`, `valueSettings` and `gateMargins`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#projects-and-goals`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#sets-and-drafts`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#draft-concurrency`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-models.md#14-default-model`

Note: Split from the phase-3.md item "Every console capability registered as an operation with its /api/v1 route; the parity test passes" (P3-01 to P3-05), because it is far larger than 8 points.

#### P3-02 Register version, release and rollout operations with dry runs

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` `Security` | Estimate: 8 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-01, P2-09, P1-07, P3-35

Publishing, rollback, promotion and rollout run through operations that gates and approvals guard.

Acceptance criteria:

- `version.list`, `version.get`, `version.diff` (`SpecDiff`), `set.publish`, `channel.rollback`, `channel.promote`, `release.list`, `rollout.get` and `rollout.change` work.
- Publish freezes the draft into version N+1 under `If-Match` and runs lints, including `interface.breaking` (consumers are apps with runs in the last 30 days until bindings land in P4b-13). An unchanged spec is a no-op unless `interfaceBump` is set.
- The eval gate is required when the production pointer is `controlled` or `full`: the same-snapshot regression gate in effectiveness-loop.md section 5.
- The `high*` rules for publish, promote and `rollout.change` apply. Moves toward safety are never gated. A failed gate returns `409 gate_not_met` with `gates`.
- `?dryRun=true` on publish, rollback, promote and rollout change returns `DryRunResult` and writes nothing. A replayed publish with the same `Idempotency-Key` creates no version.
- Each move writes `release_events` and an audit row, and bumps the pointer cache epoch, so the API serves a new version within 30 seconds.

Note: Split from the phase-3.md item "Every console capability registered as an operation with its /api/v1 route; the parity test passes" (P3-01 to P3-05), because it is far larger than 8 points.

#### P3-03 Register dataset, eval, compare and review operations

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` `Security` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-01, P1-24

Test-and-learn work runs through operations with the holdout rules enforced on the server.

Acceptance criteria:

- `dataset.list`, `dataset.create`, `dataset.import`, `dataset.cases`, `dataset.snapshot`, `dataset.export`, `eval.run` and `eval.get` (202 with `jobId` and `evalRunId`), `set.compare`, and `review.list`, `review.assign`, `review.resolve`, `review.dismiss` and `review.confirm` (session only).
- The server assigns each case's fixed split (40/40/20 from a hash of `state_hash`). The test split never appears in any response. Per-case calibration results come back only with `includeCases: true`, and those cases are burned.
- An agent resolving a kind `action` item leaves it `pending_confirmation` until a person calls `review.confirm`. Agent labels count toward nothing until confirmed.
- Evals and compares use the eval limiter bucket.

#### P3-04 Register run, usage, report, audit, alert, model and org operations

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-08

Read surfaces and the remaining Phase 3 operations exist for the console, CLI and MCP.

Acceptance criteria:

#### P3-05 Enforce the full parity test in CI

Labels: `QA / Evals` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-12

No capability can exist only in the console.

Acceptance criteria:

- The test fails when an operation has no route or no OpenAPI path, when a curated MCP tool or CLI command maps to no operation or to a session-only one, or when code under `app/(org)/**` or `app/(platform)/**` imports a repository.
- A token calling a session-only operation gets `403 insufficient_scope`.

Labels: `Console UI` `Security` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-08, P1-05

People shape and protect state before it reaches the model.

Acceptance criteria:

- Edit `input.schema` and `redactPaths`, with `redact.path_unknown` shown.
- A token preflight meter against the profile limits warns at 80 percent.
- The adapter picker stays hidden until Phase 5 (P5-03), so sets run on raw JSON state.

#### P3-13 Build the publish flow with lints, eval gate and dry-run preview

Labels: `Console UI` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-02, P3-32

Publishing shows exactly what will change and what blocks it.

Acceptance criteria:

- The dialog sends `If-Match` with the draft ETag.
- It shows lints (including the model lints and `interface.breaking`), the eval gate result when production is `controlled` or `full`, changelog, channel choice and the dry-run preview (diff, lints, gates, `approvalRequired`, `interfaceChange`).

#### P3-16 Add the jobs endpoint GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-08, P0-18

Long work runs as jobs that any client can poll.

Acceptance criteria:

- Long work returns `202 { jobId }`. `GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}` returns `{ id, kind, status, result?, error?, createdAt, finishedAt? }` with `Retry-After` while running.
- Kinds `eval`, `compare`, `calibrate`, `improve`, `try_model`, `policy_suggest` and `export` on the ADR-005 jobs runner.
- A finished job emits `job.completed`, and an eval job also emits `eval.completed`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#jobs`

#### P3-17 Send approval emails and the 24-hour reminder

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` `Security` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-09

People learn about pending agent requests without watching the console.

Acceptance criteria:

- On `approval.requested`, email every member whose role can decide, plus the token's own user, with the operation, reason and console URL.
- A request still pending after 24 hours is emailed once more.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#approvals`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#background-jobs`

Note: management-api.md specifies these emails. The matching line under the phase-3.md approvals item is a pending edit.

#### P3-18 Build the approvals decision UI with diff, gates and dry run

Labels: `Console UI` `bandwise:headless` `Security` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-28, P3-02

Approvers see everything they need to decide.

Acceptance criteria:

- Each request shows the stored input, a diff, gate results and the dry-run preview.

#### P3-19 Build agent token management for admins

Labels: `Console UI` `Security` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-27, P2-06

Admins can see and revoke every agent token in the org.

Acceptance criteria:

- Admins see every member's tokens with scopes, ceiling, client, last use and expiry, and can revoke any of them.
- Members manage their own tokens.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#agent-tokens`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#identity-tokens-and-admin`

#### P3-20 Serve the event feed GET /api/v1/events

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-08

Agents with no public URL read events through a cursor feed.

Acceptance criteria:

- A cursor feed per events.md, filterable by type. Events are pruned after 30 days.
- An `sk_` app token with `events:read` sees only `review.created`, `review.sla_breached` and `review.resolved` for runs made with that app's tokens.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/events.md#pull-feed-phase-3`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/events.md#catalog`

#### P3-21 Serve the feedback API with a server-derived source

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` `Security` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-08, P2-12

Apps report outcomes so precision can be measured in every rollout stage.

Acceptance criteria:

- `POST /api/v1/feedback` (`feedback.report`) takes 1 to 1,000 `FeedbackReport` items matched by `runId` or `externalRef`, each idempotent on its own key, with `created`, `duplicate` or `error` per item.
- The server sets the source: `app` for `sk_` tokens, `agent` for agent tokens. A body `source` that differs returns `400 invalid_request`. Agent rows count toward nothing until a person confirms them.
- `pk_` and browser tokens are refused.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/api.md#feedback`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#3-truth-sources-phase-3`

#### P3-22 Build the bandwise CLI foundation: login, profiles, status, bandwise api

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-07, P0-12

Agents and CI drive Bandwise from a published CLI.

Acceptance criteria:

- `bandwise login` (device flow) and `logout`, named profiles per org, and `status` (`actor.get`). Credentials resolve from `--profile`, then `BANDWISE_TOKEN`, then the config profile, then the default profile.
- `--json` on every command. No prompts without a TTY (`--yes`). Exit codes 0, 1, 2 and 3 (approval pending).
- Mutations send a generated `Idempotency-Key` and retry safely. Errors print `code`, `message` and each `details` item.
- `bandwise api <operationId>` and `bandwise api --list` are built from `openapi.json` and refuse session-only operations.
- The CLI never touches the database, never calls TypeSafe and never stores a TypeSafe key.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#bandwisecli`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#profiles`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#any-operation-bandwise-api`

Note: Split from the phase-3.md @bandwise/cli item (P3-22 to P3-24), because it is larger than 8 points.

#### P3-23 Add the Phase 3 named CLI commands

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-22, P3-01, P3-02, P3-03, P3-04, P3-21

Common operations have named commands.

Acceptance criteria:

- Every Phase 3 row in the command tables (identity and admin; goals, sets and releases; datasets, evals and runs; review, feedback, reports and events) maps to its operation.
- Approval-gated commands exit 3 until a person approves.
- The parity test covers each command's mapping.

Note: Split from the phase-3.md @bandwise/cli item (P3-22 to P3-24), because it is larger than 8 points.

#### P3-24 Add specs as code: spec pull, push, diff, validate, datasets push

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-22, P3-01, P3-03

Specs live in the customer repo and publish without an app redeploy.

Acceptance criteria:

- Repo layout `bandwise.config.json`, `bandwise/sets/<slug>.json` and `bandwise/datasets/<slug>/<name>.jsonl`. `.bandwise/specs.json` keeps the draft ETag for `If-Match`.
- `spec pull`, `push` (with `--create`), `diff` and `validate` map to their operations. Versions record `source` and `source_ref`.
- `datasets push` sends only new lines and stops with exit 1 when earlier lines changed.

Agents manage Bandwise through MCP with the same rules as the CLI.

Acceptance criteria:

- `packages/mcp-server` runs over stdio and authenticates with an agent token (`BANDWISE_TOKEN` or a profile), never an `sk_` token or a TypeSafe key.
- Every Phase 3 curated tool maps to its operation, with JSON Schema from the zod input and `readOnlyHint` and `destructiveHint` from the registry.
- A gated call returns the pending approval and its URL. One server entry per profile.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#mcp-server`

#### P3-26 Regenerate OpenAPI and MSW mocks from the registry

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-01, P3-02, P3-03, P3-04

Clients build against real shapes, not placeholders.

Acceptance criteria:

- `openapi.json` and the MSW handlers regenerate from the registry with no placeholder shapes left for Phase 2 and Phase 3 operations.
- The snapshot test passes, and the Embed Kit builds against the mocks.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#openapi-and-the-parity-test`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/api.md`

#### P3-27 Build the playground with structural and behavioral diffs

Labels: `Console UI` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-03, P3-14

People compare two versions before they publish.

Acceptance criteria:

- Pick two versions and one state or a dataset. Show the structural diff, the behavioral diff, a flipped cases table and the cost delta.
- Runs through `set.compare` in the eval limiter bucket.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-3.md#test-and-learn`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#datasets-evals-and-jobs`

#### P3-28 Build the runs explorer and run detail

Labels: `Console UI` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-04

People find any run and see what happened in it.

Acceptance criteria:

- `run.list` filters by set, version, channel, source, status, band, action and date range.
- Run detail shows per-stage payloads and answers. State shows only when the set stored it.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#runs-and-usage`

#### P3-29 Build the review queue for action and label items

Labels: `Console UI` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-03

Reviewers work one queue for decisions and labels.

Acceptance criteria:

- Kind `action` and `label` items show the reason each was picked. Assign, resolve, dismiss, add to dataset and SLA timers work.
- Agent resolutions wait in `pending_confirmation` until a person confirms them.
- Resolving an item can add a dataset case.

#### P3-30 Build the audit sampler per the labeling policy

Labels: `Quality / Learning` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-19, P0-10

A random audit sample keeps precision honest in every rollout stage.

Acceptance criteria:

- `selectForLabeling` in `packages/core/src/learning` takes injected randomness. Audit picks come first, uniform per band, and store the rate used, lowering it for the rest of the day when the budget runs short.
- Targeted picks carry `sample_rate` null and never feed gates or health precision.
- `RunSink` writes label items in the run's transaction. Label items never block the caller or change `effectiveAction`.
- A seeded run stream with a known precision gives the same estimate at any audit rate, within its interval.

#### P3-31 Build dataset screens with fixed splits and snapshots

Labels: `Console UI` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-03

People build and freeze datasets without ever seeing the test split.

Acceptance criteria:

- Create datasets, import JSONL, and browse drafting and calibration cases (never test) with each case's split shown.
- Take snapshots (`dataset_snapshots`).

#### P3-32 Build eval runs on snapshots with calibration charts

Labels: `Console UI` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-03, P3-16

People see how a version and model perform on a fixed snapshot.

Acceptance criteria:

- Start `eval.run` on a `snapshotId` with an optional model.
- Show per-question and per-band metrics with Wilson lower bounds, the reliability table and calibration charts.
- Each eval run records its model and snapshot.

#### P3-33 Build the Definition Studio operations and server holdout rules

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` `Security` | Estimate: 8 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-03, P1-10

Studio sessions work the same for people and agents, with holdout enforced by the server.

Acceptance criteria:

- `studio_sessions` and the `studio.*` operations: list, create, get, add_examples, draft_definition, decompose, calibrate, request_labels and promote.
- Drafting and decomposing call `llm-client` with the drafting split only.
- Calibration is aggregate by default, and `includeCases: true` burns those cases. The test split is never returned. Promotion returns pass or fail and aggregate metrics.
- `studio.request_labels` creates label items with reason `studio`. Any member with `sets:write` can resume a session.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/definition-studio.md#headless-studio-and-holdout-rules`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#definition-studio`

Note: Split by lane from the phase-3.md Definition Studio item (P3-33, P3-34).

#### P3-34 Build the Definition Studio wizard

Labels: `Console UI` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-33

People turn a fuzzy question into narrow checks tested against their own judgment.

Acceptance criteria:

- The six wizard steps run on the `studio.*` operations: capture intent (with the 10-second fit test), draft a definition, decompose into checks, combine, calibrate and promote.
- Playwright covers the Studio happy path.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/definition-studio.md#wizard-steps`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/definition-studio.md#fit-test-first-the-10-second-rule`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#playwright`

#### P3-35 Build the gate evaluator with Wilson lower bounds

Labels: `Quality / Learning` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-10

Rollout and publish gates use lower bounds, never point estimates.

Acceptance criteria:

- Pure gate logic in `packages/core/src/learning` covers each move in confidence-policy.md and compares the 95 percent Wilson lower bound (Kish effective sample size for weighted audit rows) with the goal's `QualityTarget`.
- Below `minLabeledHigh` a gate returns `insufficient_data`, never pass.
- The same-snapshot regression gate uses `gate_margins.coverageDrop` and `gate_margins.reviewLoadRise` (defaults 0.02 and 0.10).
- Precision counts only the truth rows defined in effectiveness-loop.md section 2. Results are `GateResult` items.

#### P3-36 Run the hourly gate evaluator and auto-demote job

Labels: `Quality / Learning` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-35, P3-02

Live sets that stop meeting their target step down on their own.

Acceptance criteria:

- Hourly, per production channel. Emits `rollout.gate_met` when the next stage's gates are met.
- Auto-demote moves `full` to `controlled` and `controlled` to `shadow` through `rollout.change` as the system actor, and never sets `paused`. Triggers: the precision lower bound below target over 7 days, band-mix PSI above 0.2 against the baseline, or a resolved model change.
- Emits `rollout.auto_demoted` and `alert.raised` (`precision_below_target`, `band_drift`).
- An injected precision drop demotes a `full` set to `controlled`.

#### P3-37 Warn when a live set has no truth source

Labels: `Quality / Learning` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-36, P3-21, P3-30

A set with nothing to measure against never looks healthy by accident.

Acceptance criteria:

- A set with no app feedback and no audit sample shows the warning on `rollout.get` and in the console.
- It raises `alert.raised` with kind `no_truth_source`, and its precision-based auto-demote is marked inactive.

The platform admin reviews new models before any org can publish on them.

Acceptance criteria:

- Review unreviewed models and set status, limits, question types, weaknesses, `supersedes` and `retireAt` through `platform_model.update`.
- Every write is audited.

Labels: `Console UI` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-04

Org members see which models they can use and how each behaves.

Acceptance criteria:

- `model.list` shows each reachable model with status, pinned or moving, limits and the default.
- The registry sync, alias probe and contract watch jobs already run from Phase 1 (P1-20).

#### P3-40 Enforce model lints at publish

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-02, P1-06

No set reaches a channel on a model that is not ready for it.

Acceptance criteria:

- `set.publish` and `channel.promote` pass a `PublishCtx` with `reachableModels` and `allowPreviewModels`, so every model lint always runs at publish.
- A set cannot be published on an unreviewed model.

#### P3-41 Build savings and usage dashboards for org, project and set

Labels: `Console UI` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-04, P2-25

Admins see what System One cost and saved.

Acceptance criteria:

- From `usage.get`: runs, System One spend and savings by kind, labeled as estimates with their assumptions shown.
- Would-be savings from suppressed runs show apart.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/savings-model.md#rollups-usage_daily`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/savings-model.md#honesty-rules`

#### P3-42 Build the standard reports with CSV export and monthly PDF

Labels: `Billing` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-04, P2-25

Every standard report is available in the console, as CSV, as PDF and headless.

Acceptance criteria:

- `usage-and-cost`, `savings-and-roi`, `band-distribution`, `review-queue`, `human-agreement`, `model-upgrades` and `rate-headroom` through `report.get` with csv and pdf. `effectiveness` follows once set health lands (P3b-06).
- The portfolio view loops over each org with that org's own tenant context. The platform admin sees the reports across orgs.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/savings-model.md#standard-admin-reports`

#### P3-43 Add the model upgrades report and alias-moved and deprecation alerts

Labels: `Billing` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-42, P1-20

Admins learn when a model moves or retires.

Acceptance criteria:

- Alias-moved (`model.alias_moved`) and deprecation alerts show in the console and go out by email.
- The `model-upgrades` report lists pinned sets behind the latest stable model and alias sets whose resolved model changed. Eval deltas arrive in Phase 3b (P3b-21).

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/savings-model.md#standard-admin-reports`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-models.md#6-detection`

#### P3-44 Build the audit log viewer with filters and CSV export

Labels: `Console UI` `Security` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-04

Admins answer who changed what, through which client, and who approved it.

Acceptance criteria:

- `audit.list` filters by action, user, token and date range, with CSV export. A CSV export is itself audited.
- Rows show actor type, client, approval id and the impersonator when present.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#audit`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#reports-audit-and-events`

#### P3-45 Pass the Phase 3 exit gate

Labels: `QA / Evals` `bandwise:headless` `Security` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-05, P3-06, P3-07, P3-09, P3-10, P3-11, P3-12, P3-13, P3-15, P3-17, P3-18, P3-19, P3-23, P3-24, P3-25, P3-26, P3-27, P3-28, P3-29, P3-31, P3-34, P3-37, P3-38, P3-39, P3-40, P3-41, P3-43, P3-44

Confirm Phase 3 is done. Phases 3b, 4 and 4b then run in parallel.

Acceptance criteria:

- Playwright: create a set, publish, set the production rollout to `shadow`, call it through the API, publish v2, the API serves v2 within 30 seconds with no redeploy, roll back, and the API serves v1.
- With production at `controlled`, medium and low band answers on gating decisions create review items of kind `action`, and resolving one can add a dataset case.
- Headless gate: an agent with only an agent token, using only the CLI or MCP, creates a set from a template, edits and validates the draft (fixing JSON lint errors), runs an eval, publishes to staging, promotes to production, sets the production rollout to shadow, resolves review items and reads the savings report. With the set marked protected, it requests a production publish of v2, which stays pending until a person approves it in the console, and rolls back through the API.
- Replaying a publish with the same `Idempotency-Key` creates no new version.
- A viewer cannot mutate anything. An agent token without a scope gets `403 insufficient_scope` in its own org and `404` across orgs.
- Every mutation writes an audit row with actor type, client and approval id.
- An injected precision drop auto-demotes a `full` set to `controlled`.
- A set cannot be published on an unreviewed model.

### Bandwise P3b: Effectiveness loop

Policy replay and threshold suggestions, set health, proposals, champion/challenger, model upgrades, Studio improve mode and quality-adjusted value.

Lead role: Quality / Learning. Depends on: Bandwise P3: Console and management API. Starts when Phase 3 lands. Runs in parallel with P4 and P4b. Checklist: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-3b.md`. 31 issues, 102 points.

#### P3b-01 Build policy replay in packages/core/src/learning

Labels: `Quality / Learning` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-03

Candidate policies are scored on stored answers at no System One cost.

Acceptance criteria:

- Re-routes stored answers under a candidate policy with zero System One calls (the transport's call count stays 0).
- On fixtures, replay under a policy matches a live run with that policy.
- Replay reads the stored `checks` and never re-runs them, so a purged run replays the same relevance as long as no condition reads `input`.

#### P3b-02 Build suggestThresholds returning ThresholdProposal

Labels: `Quality / Learning` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-01, P3-35

Thresholds are suggested from labels, with the target as a hard floor.

Acceptance criteria:

- Picks the loosest threshold whose Wilson lower bound meets `highPrecision` or `mediumPrecision`, and never proposes one that misses it.
- Returns `insufficientData` below the label minimum, with `proposed` equal to `current`.
- Covers choice and score thresholds, `perOption` overrides with enough labels, and noul `trueAt`, `falseAt` and `reviewMargin`. Leaves composite `levelThresholds` alone.
- Reads only counted truth rows and the drafting and calibration splits, never the test split.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#6-policy-replay-and-the-threshold-suggester-phase-3b`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#policy-replay-tests`

Note: Split by lane from the phase-3b.md threshold suggester item (P3b-02 to P3b-05): Quality / Learning writes the logic, Platform the operation, Console UI the editor action, Integrations the CLI and MCP surface.

#### P3b-03 Add the policy.suggest operation as a job

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-02, P3-16

Anyone can request threshold suggestions through the API.

Acceptance criteria:

- `POST /api/v1/sets/{ref}/policy-suggestions` returns `202 { jobId }` and replays with zero System One calls.
- With `apply: true` it writes the suggested thresholds to the draft through `draft.update`, needs `sets:write` and `If-Match`, and fails with `412` if the draft changed.

#### P3b-04 Add "Suggest from labels" to the policy editor

Labels: `Console UI` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-03, P3-11

People tune thresholds from their own labels in the editor.

Acceptance criteria:

- Shows the curve with precision, lower bound, coverage and net value per candidate threshold.
- Applying writes the draft only.

#### P3b-05 Add MCP suggest_thresholds and bandwise tune

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-03, P3-23, P3-25

Agents tune thresholds headlessly.

Acceptance criteria:

- `bandwise tune <slug> [--apply]` and MCP `suggest_thresholds` (with `apply`) map to `policy.suggest`.
- `--apply` sends `If-Match` from `.bandwise/specs.json` or `draft.get`. The parity test covers both.

#### P3b-06 Build the question_daily rollup and SetHealth

Labels: `Quality / Learning` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-35, P3-30

Each set, version and question reports its health against its target.

Acceptance criteria:

- A nightly `question_daily` rollup feeds `SetHealth` per set, version and question.
- Status order `no_truth_source`, `drifting`, `insufficient_data`, `below_target`, `ok`, against a baseline of the first 14 days after the last promotion. There is no single score.
- A hash-only set says plainly that review shows no content and replay is unavailable.

#### P3b-07 Add the health.get and health.list operations

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-06

Set health is readable through the API.

Acceptance criteria:

- `GET /api/v1/sets/{ref}/health` and `GET /api/v1/health` (worst first by status order, then by review load), scope `reports:read`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#health-tuning-and-proposals-phase-3b`

#### P3b-08 Build the Health tab and the org "Needs attention" list

Labels: `Console UI` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-07

People see which sets need attention first.

Acceptance criteria:

- The set page has a Health tab with per-question metrics and flags.
- The org "Needs attention" list shows sets worst first.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#7-set-health-phase-3b`

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 1 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-07, P3-23, P3-25

Agents read set health headlessly.

Acceptance criteria:

- `bandwise health [<slug>]` and MCP `get_set_health` map to `health.get` and `health.list`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#effectiveness-loop`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#mcp-server`

#### P3b-10 Add the proposals table and proposal operations

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-01

Recommendations and improvements share one queue that people and agents work.

Acceptance criteria:

- `proposals` holds the eight kinds with `evidence`, `metrics_delta`, `rationale` and `draft_version_id`. One open proposal per set, kind and decision. Open proposals expire after 30 days or when the evidence no longer applies.
- `proposal.list`, `proposal.accept` (applies the patch through `draft.update` with `If-Match`; `label_more` and `demote` return the operation to call) and `proposal.reject`.
- Each new proposal emits `proposal.created`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#8-proposals-phase-3b`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#health-tuning-and-proposals-phase-3b`

#### P3b-11 Build the weekly threshold-refit job and health-rule proposals

Labels: `Quality / Learning` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-02, P3b-06, P3b-10

The loop suggests improvements on its own schedule.

Acceptance criteria:

- Weekly `tune_thresholds` proposals when coverage can rise at the same guaranteed precision or precision is below target.
- Nightly health rules open `label_more`, `demote`, `add_none_option` and stability proposals per effectiveness-loop.md sections 8 and 12.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#15-jobs`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#8-proposals-phase-3b`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#12-stability-phase-3b`

#### P3b-12 Build the proposals inbox

Labels: `Console UI` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-10

People review and accept proposals in one place.

Acceptance criteria:

- Lists proposals with evidence, metric deltas and rationale.
- Accepting creates a draft only. Nothing publishes on its own.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#8-proposals-phase-3b`

#### P3b-13 Add MCP proposal tools, update_set and bandwise proposals

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-10, P3-23, P3-25

Agents work the proposal queue headlessly.

Acceptance criteria:

- `bandwise proposals list|accept|reject` and MCP `list_proposals` and `decide_proposal` map to the proposal operations.
- MCP `update_set` maps to `set.update`, so an agent can act on an accepted `label_more` proposal.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#effectiveness-loop`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#mcp-server`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#c-improve-a-live-set-phase-3b`

#### P3b-14 Add the experiments table and experiment operations

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` `Security` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-02

Champion and challenger comparisons are first-class records.

Acceptance criteria:

- `experiments` (kind `version`, `model` or `policy`), `release_pointers.active_experiment_id`, and `runs.experiment_id` and `arm`. At most one experiment per set and channel.
- `experiment.start` (`samplePct` from 0 to 1, default 0.1; above 0.25 it is high risk for agents), `experiment.get`, `experiment.promote` (high; moves the pointer, writes `experiment_promote`, emits `release.promoted` and `experiment.decided`) and `experiment.stop` (toward safety, callable by the system actor).

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#experiments-phase-3b`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#9-experiments-phase-3b`

#### P3b-15 Dual-run the challenger on a sample after the champion responds

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-14

Challengers are tested on real traffic without touching the caller.

Acceptance criteria:

- After the champion's result returns, the console run service calls `sampleChallenger` from `core/learning` and runs the challenger off the latency path.
- The challenger run has `arm` challenger, books experiment cost and no savings, dispatches no actions, creates no action review items and never changes `effectiveAction`.
- Disagreements create label items with reason `challenger_diff`. Policy experiments replay instead of dual-running.

#### P3b-16 Start an experiment on production publish of controlled or full sets

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` `Security` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-14

New versions of live sets prove themselves before they take over.

Acceptance criteria:

- For `set.publish` and `channel.promote` to production at `controlled` or `full` without `skipExperiment`, the pointer stays on the champion, the new version becomes the challenger, and the response includes `experimentId`.
- `skipExperiment` needs the admin role and is always gated for agents.

#### P3b-17 Build the experiment scorer job and the promotion rule

Labels: `Quality / Learning` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-14, P3b-01, P3-35

Experiments end with a clear, safe result.

Acceptance criteria:

- Runs hourly while an experiment runs and decides nothing before `min_runs` and `min_labeled`.
- Stops the experiment (as the system actor) when the challenger cannot win or after 30 days, and emits `experiment.decided`.
- Promotion rule on the same labeled runs: the challenger's high-band lower bound is at least the champion's, and its coverage drops by no more than `gate_margins.coverageDrop`. Net value is shown and never overrides them.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#9-experiments-phase-3b`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#15-jobs`

#### P3b-18 Add MCP experiment tools and bandwise experiments commands

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-14, P3-23, P3-25

Agents run experiments headlessly, with approval for promotion.

Acceptance criteria:

- `bandwise experiments start|get|promote|stop` and MCP `start_experiment`, `get_experiment` and `decide_experiment` map to the experiment operations.
- Promotion by an agent returns a pending approval (exit 3).

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#effectiveness-loop`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#mcp-server`

#### P3b-19 Add the set.try_model operation as a job

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:models` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-02, P3b-10, P3-03, P3-16

Any set can be tried on a new model with evidence before anyone switches.

Acceptance criteria:

- `POST /api/v1/sets/{ref}/try-model` builds a candidate spec (production with only the model changed), evals both on the same snapshot, re-tunes thresholds on the candidate's answers, and opens a `model_upgrade` proposal.
- It never writes the set's draft. Only `proposal.accept` does.
- It supports `?dryRun=true` and uses the eval limiter bucket.
- On the `internal` dogfood sets, a try from `jev-1.13.0` to `jev-1.14.0` reproduces the manual D5 eval (`.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-d.md`) within its intervals.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#models`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#10-new-system-one-models-phase-3b`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-models.md#11-new-model-upgrade-flow`

Note: effectiveness-loop.md section 10 still says try-model clones production into a draft. management-api.md (it never writes the draft) wins; that wording fix is pending.

#### P3b-20 Build the model-upgrade candidates job

Labels: `Quality / Learning` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-20, P3-43

Every set that could move to a new model is listed when that model is ready.

Acceptance criteria:

- Runs when a model becomes `stable` (or `preview` for orgs that allow preview models). It spends nothing.
- A live set is a candidate when it is pinned to an older model in the same family or to a model in the new model's `supersedes`, and the new model's `questionTypes` cover the set's question types. Candidates found only through `supersedes` are marked cross-family.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/system-one-models.md#6-detection`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/effectiveness-loop.md#10-new-system-one-models-phase-3b`

Note: Listing the `jev-1.13.0` dogfood sets as candidates for `jev-1.14.0` (the phase-3b.md acceptance case) needs registry data that orders the two, and `jev-1.13.0` has `releaseDate` null. Reading versions out of ids would be a name pattern match, and model facts come from the registry (golden rules 6 and 12). The open question is in `docs/PLAN.md` (Open items, Jev 1.14 decisions).

#### P3b-21 Add eval deltas to model.upgrades and the model-upgrades report

Labels: `Billing` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-20, P3b-19

Admins compare upgrade options with evidence.

Acceptance criteria:

- `model.upgrades` (`GET /api/v1/model-upgrades`) and the `model-upgrades` report show eval and experiment deltas per pinned set and the cross-family marker.
- Sets still pinned to a deprecated model are listed.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/savings-model.md#standard-admin-reports`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#models`

#### P3b-22 Build the Model upgrades page

Labels: `Console UI` `bandwise:models` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-21

People act on model upgrades from one page.

Acceptance criteria:

- Lists candidate sets per new model with eval deltas, and starts try-model from each row.

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:models` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-19, P3b-21, P3-23, P3-25

Agents run model upgrades headlessly.

Acceptance criteria:

- `bandwise upgrade list` maps to `model.upgrades`, `bandwise upgrade try <slug> --model <id>` and MCP `try_model` map to `set.try_model`.

Labels: `Quality / Learning` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 8 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-33, P3b-10, P1-10

Published sets get better wording without leaking the test split.

Acceptance criteria:

- Opens a Studio session on a published set. Claude, through `llm-client`, proposes `ImproveEdit` items from the drafting split only.
- Each candidate is scored on the calibration split under the session cost cap and the eval bucket. Only the best is confirmed once on the test split, with aggregate metrics only.
- The output is a proposal (`question_fix`, `add_none_option`, `split_question` or `narrow_state`) with a draft diff and metric deltas. Accepting writes the draft. Nothing publishes.

#### P3b-25 Build the Studio improve screen

Labels: `Console UI` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3b-24, P3-34

People run improve mode from the Studio.

Acceptance criteria:

- Shows disagreements per question, candidate edits with calibration scores, and the resulting proposal with its diff and deltas.

#### P3b-27 Add eval repeats and a per-question stability metric

Labels: `QA / Evals` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-24, P3-03

Evals measure how stable each question's answer is.

Acceptance criteria:

- `--repeats <k>` and `eval.run` `repeats` are off by default. When on, k = 3 on a 10 percent sample of cases within the eval cost cap.
- Each repeat adds a throwaway `uid` field after validation, outside `input.schema`.
- Stability is the share of repeated cases whose value and band stay the same. Eval metrics record it and set health shows it.

#### P3b-28 Copy labeled and feedback runs into dataset_cases before purge

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `Security` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-03, P2-15

Labels outlive the state they were made on.

Acceptance criteria:

- The nightly retention job copies runs picked for labeling or with feedback into `dataset_cases` (`source = 'production'`), redacted per `pii_mode`, with answers, `version_id` and `model_resolved`, before state is purged.

Confirm the effectiveness loop works end to end.

Acceptance criteria:

- On a seeded set with 500 labeled fixture runs, an agent using only MCP tools gets a threshold suggestion, applies it to a draft, runs a challenger, and promotes it after admin approval.
- Registering a new stable model lists every pinned candidate set on the Model upgrades page, and try-model produces an eval comparison and a proposal.
- Injected drift triggers auto-demote and an alert event.
- No endpoint returns a test-split case.

### Bandwise P4b: Integrate and deploy

Opportunities, TypeScript codegen, app bindings, bandwise init, codegen and check, and the interface-breaking guard. Python and the standalone export stay behind ADR-009.

Lead role: Integrations. Depends on: Bandwise P3: Console and management API. Starts when Phase 3 lands and runs in parallel with P3b and P4. The TypeScript target builds against the @bandwise/client types (P4-01) until that package lands. Checklist: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-4b.md`. 23 issues, 69 points.

#### P4b-01 Add app profile fields language, framework and repo_url

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` | Estimate: 1 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-05

Apps carry what codegen and opportunities need.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#3-pattern-advisor`

#### P4b-06 Prefill the Definition Studio from an Opportunity

Labels: `Console UI` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P4b-02, P3-34

Building a set from an opportunity starts with the right context.

Acceptance criteria:

- The Studio fills the intent sentence, state fields and seed examples from the chosen `Opportunity`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/definition-studio.md#1-capture-intent`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#1-integrate-flow`

#### P4b-07 Build the packages/codegen TypeScript target

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P1-07

Apps call sets through typed code derived from the spec.

Acceptance criteria:

- Pure: `SetInterface` plus manifest in, files out. Imports only core contracts.
- Generated code calls `@bandwise/client`'s `run<T>()`, built against its types until P4-01 lands.
- One read-only generated file per set. One snapshot per seeded template. Generated TypeScript passes `tsc --noEmit`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#6-codegen`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#typescript-output`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#codegen-tests`

Generated code is available from the API.

Acceptance criteria:

- `GET /api/v1/sets/{ref}/codegen` takes `lang`, `channel`, `version`, `appId` and `target`, and returns `{ files, lock, bindingId? }`.
- With `appId` it also records a binding and checks `apps:write`. A channel with no published version returns `404 not_found`.
- `target=standalone` returns 404 until the ADR-009 Standalone section is accepted.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#surfaces`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#apps-and-integration`

#### P4b-09 Add bandwise codegen and MCP generate_client

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P4b-08, P3-22

Developers and agents write generated code into the app repo.

Acceptance criteria:

- `bandwise codegen <slug> --lang ts [--channel <c>] [--version <n>] [--app <id>]` writes `bandwise/generated/<slug>.ts` and records a binding.
- MCP `generate_client` returns the files and the lock entry for the agent to write.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#surfaces`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#8-delivering-code-into-an-app-repo`

Labels: `Console UI` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P4b-08

People copy generated code and record a binding from the console.

Acceptance criteria:

- Shows the generated file for the app's language, copy and download buttons and the plain HTTP snippet.
- "Use in app" records a binding through `binding.create`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#surfaces`

Note: Split by lane from the phase-4b.md codegen surfaces item (P4b-08 to P4b-10).

#### P4b-11 Add app_set_bindings and the binding operations

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P4b-01

Bandwise knows which app uses which set, where and through what code.

Acceptance criteria:

- `binding.list`, `binding.create` and `binding.remove`. A new binding for the same app, set and channel sets `removed_at` on the previous row, so the table is the deploy history.
- Audit actions `binding.create` and `binding.remove`, and event `binding.created`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#7-app-bindings`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#apps-and-integration`

Note: Split by lane from the phase-4b.md app bindings item (P4b-11, P4b-12).

#### P4b-12 Build the app page and the set Consumers panel

Labels: `Console UI` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P4b-11

People see what each app uses and who consumes each set.

Acceptance criteria:

- The app page shows sets in use, channel, served version, interface major and last run.
- The set page and the publish dialog show a Consumers panel: bindings plus apps with runs in the last 30 days.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#7-app-bindings`

Note: Split by lane from the phase-4b.md app bindings item (P4b-11, P4b-12).

#### P4b-13 Make interface.breaking use bindings plus recent app runs

Labels: `Core Engine` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P4b-11, P1-06, P1-07

A publish that would break a live app fails loudly.

Acceptance criteria:

- Consumers per channel are live bindings plus apps with runs in the last 30 days, passed in `PublishCtx.served`.
- Only `interfaceBump` with an audited reason clears the lint.
- Publishing a version that removes a route output a bound production app uses fails unless the major is bumped.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#5-set-interface-and-compatibility`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#lints-packagescoresrclints`

#### P4b-14 Enforce the Bandwise-Interface header on runs

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `bandwise:contract` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P2-12

An app built against an old interface never gets a silent mismatch.

Acceptance criteria:

- A `Bandwise-Interface` major that differs from the version's returns `409 interface_mismatch`.
- The server never falls back to an older version.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/api.md#run-request`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#5-set-interface-and-compatibility`

#### P4b-15 Build bandwise init

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:headless` `Security` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P4b-01, P3-22, P4-01

One command sets up an app repo.

Acceptance criteria:

- Runs the six steps in deploy-and-codegen.md: create the app, create an `sk_test_` token with `run` and `feedback:write` bound to staging (no approval needed), write `bandwise.config.json`, add `@bandwise/client`, and with `--set` generate one typed call site in a new file.
- It never writes the token secret to a tracked file.
- It needs an admin ceiling. `--app <appId>` skips app and token creation.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#bandwise-init`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#catalog`

#### P4b-16 Write .bandwise/lock.json from bandwise codegen

Labels: `Integrations` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P4b-09

#### P4b-17 Build bandwise check with exit code 2 on drift

Labels: `Integrations` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P4b-16

Customer CI catches interface drift and hand edits.

Acceptance criteria:

- Exit 0 when the lock matches the live major and every file hash, with a notice for additive changes.
- Exit 2 when the live major differs from the lock or a generated file was edited, deleted or is missing.
- Exit 1 on auth, network or unknown set.

Acceptance criteria:

- The ADR-009 Standalone section is accepted or rejected, with Security reviewer input and the reason recorded.

Refs: `docs/adr/009-app-integration-and-deploy-targets.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#9-standalone-export-behind-adr-009-last-in-phase-4b`

Note: Added: phase-4b.md gates the standalone export on this decision without a checklist line for it.

#### P4b-21 Build the standalone export and POST /api/v1/runs/ingest

Labels: `Integrations` `Security` | Estimate: 8 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P4b-20, P4b-07

Customers can run a set on their own key and still report back.

Acceptance criteria:

- Exports `typesafe/<slug>.questions.ts` (or `.py`) with a band and route helper golden-tested against the core router table.
- The code reads the customer's own key from their server env. Bandwise never exports a stored key.
- `run.ingest` (`runs:write`) keeps the ledger, review and calibration working for exported sets.
- Starts only after the ADR-009 Standalone section is accepted. The Security reviewer signs off.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#9-standalone-export-behind-adr-009-last-in-phase-4b`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/api.md#endpoints-run-surface`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#codegen-tests`

#### P4b-22 Review codegen output and bandwise init tokens for security

Labels: `Security review` `Security` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P4b-07, P4b-09, P4b-15

The Security reviewer signs off on code and tokens that reach customer repos.

Acceptance criteria:

- The bundle scan covers generated browser code.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#security-tests`

Note: Added: phase-4b.md names the Security reviewer as an owner. Standalone sign-off is part of P4b-21.

#### P4b-23 Pass the Phase 4b exit gate

Labels: `QA / Evals` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P4b-03, P4b-04, P4b-05, P4b-06, P4b-10, P4b-12, P4b-13, P4b-14, P4b-17, P4b-22

Confirm an agent can wire a set into an app with no console clicks.

Acceptance criteria:

- In a sample Next.js repo with no System One code, an agent using only the CLI or MCP and an agent token records an opportunity, builds a set, publishes it to staging, generates and wires the typed client, and, with the set marked protected, requests promotion to production, which a person approves. The console app page then shows the binding.
- Publishing a version that removes a route output a bound production app uses fails the lint unless the major is bumped with a reason.
- `bandwise check` exits 2 after a generated file is edited or the live interface major changes.
- Generated TypeScript passes `tsc --noEmit` for every seeded template.

Labels: `Extensions` `Security` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P5-01

Auto decisions can act on the outside world safely.

Acceptance criteria:

- Webhook (HMAC signed), Slack, email and create review item.
- Side-effect handlers do not dispatch for staging runs unless the set sets `dispatchActionsOnStaging`.
- Handlers are idempotent under retry by `runId:decisionId`.
- `escalate_to_llm` is not a plugin action: core owns it from Phase 1.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-5.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/confidence-policy.md#escalation`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/confidence-policy.md#actions`

Note: phase-5.md still lists "escalate to LLM" as a built-in action. Removing it is a pending edit; confidence-policy.md wins.

#### P5-05 Seed the remaining nine templates, each tagged with a pattern

Labels: `Extensions` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P5-01, P4b-05

Common decisions start from a tested template.

Acceptance criteria:

- Each template builds a `Partial<QuestionSetSpec>` that includes `input.schema` and never sets `model`.
- Each creates a working set from the console and passes a fixture run.
- Each has a codegen snapshot.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/definition-studio.md#template-library-seeded`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#3-pattern-advisor`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#codegen-tests`

#### P5-06 Add per-org plugin enablement with encrypted config

Labels: `Extensions` `Security` `bandwise:tenancy` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P5-01, P2-03

Each org turns plugins on and configures them safely.

Acceptance criteria:

- `plugin.list`, `plugin.get` and `plugin.update` (admin).
- Plugin config is encrypted like keys.
- The `action.handler_unknown` lint reads the enabled handlers.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/management-api.md#identity-tokens-and-admin`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/architecture.md#lints-packagescoresrclints`

#### P5-07 Build the plugin conformance test suite

Labels: `Extensions` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P5-01

Every plugin meets the same bar.

Acceptance criteria:

- A suite every plugin must pass, including idempotency under retry for actions.
- The built-ins pass it.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-5.md`

#### P5-08 Add an example third-party plugin in examples/

Labels: `Extensions` `bandwise:docs` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P5-07

Plugin authors copy a working example.

Acceptance criteria:

- An example plugin in `examples/` passes the conformance suite.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-5.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/templates/plugin.template.ts`

#### P5-09 Deliver org event webhooks with HMAC signatures and retries

Labels: `Platform / Tenancy` `Security` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-20, P2-14

Orgs with a public URL receive events as they happen.

Acceptance criteria:

- `webhook_endpoints` with `webhook.list`, `webhook.create` and `webhook.delete`.
- Deliveries are HMAC signed with `org_webhook_secrets` and retried.
- A signature rejection test passes.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/events.md#org-webhooks-phase-5`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/testing.md#security-tests`

#### P5-10 Publish a GitHub Action for bandwise check and spec diff comments

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P4b-17, P3-24

Customer PRs show spec diffs and fail on interface drift.

Acceptance criteria:

- The Action runs `bandwise check` and comments `bandwise spec diff` on PRs, using an agent token with `sets:read`.
- It lives in `examples/` or is published.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#specs-as-code`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/deploy-and-codegen.md#8-delivering-code-into-an-app-repo`

#### P5-11 Pass the Phase 5 exit gate

Labels: `QA / Evals` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P5-03, P5-04, P5-05, P5-06, P5-08, P5-09, P5-10

Confirm plugins and templates are ready.

Acceptance criteria:

- Built-ins pass the conformance tests.
- Every template creates a working set from the console and passes a fixture run.
- Action handlers are idempotent under retry (`runId:decisionId`).

### Bandwise P6: Chrome extension

WXT MV3 extension with evaluate page and action picker modes, signed in with the device flow.

Lead role: Extensions. Depends on: Bandwise P5: Plugins and templates. Needs the Phase 5 web page adapter. Runs in parallel with P7. Checklist: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-6.md`. 9 issues, 30 points.

#### P6-01 Scaffold the WXT MV3 extension with activeTab and storage only

Labels: `Extensions` `Security` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P0-07

The extension starts with the smallest permission set.

Acceptance criteria:

- WXT, MV3, permissions `activeTab` and `storage` only.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-6.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#extensions`

#### P6-02 Sign in with the device flow and keep the token in session storage

Labels: `Extensions` `Security` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P6-01, P2-07

The extension acts for one user with a narrow agent token.

Acceptance criteria:

- Sign in uses the device flow and receives an agent token with client `extension` and scopes `run`, `sets:read`, `review:read` and `review:write`.
- The token lives in `chrome.storage.session`. No TypeSafe key is anywhere in the extension.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-6.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#agent-tokens`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#extensions`

#### P6-03 Add the org and set picker

Labels: `Extensions` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P6-02

Users choose which org and set the extension runs.

Acceptance criteria:

- Pick an org profile and a set the token can run.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-6.md`

#### P6-04 Build evaluate page mode with the web page adapter

Labels: `Extensions` `Security` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P6-03, P5-02, P4-06

Users evaluate a page with a set and see the confidence.

Acceptance criteria:

- Extracts the selection, readable text or custom per-site selectors through the web page adapter, then previews and redacts state.
- Nothing is sent before the user clicks.
- Shows `ConfidenceBadge` and `ProbabilityBars` in a side panel and sends medium and low to review.
- Works on three sample pages.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-6.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#state-is-untrusted`

#### P6-05 Build action picker mode

Labels: `Extensions` `Security` | Estimate: 8 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P6-04

One Choice picks the next UI action on a page, with no screenshots.

Acceptance criteria:

- The page becomes a numbered list of clickable elements, and one Choice picks the action and element.
- Per-option probabilities are shown. A small LLM handles typing only. No screenshots.
- Completes one scripted task on an allowlisted test site.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-6.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/definition-studio.md#template-library-seeded`

#### P6-06 Enforce the autonomy rule for extension clicks

Labels: `Extensions` `Security` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P6-05

The extension clicks on its own only when it is safe to.

Acceptance criteria:

- It clicks on its own only for high-band answers on org-allowlisted sites, and only when the set's production rollout is `full`. Everything else waits for confirmation.
- An injected-instruction test page does not trigger an autonomous click.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-6.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#state-is-untrusted`

#### P6-07 Default web page adapter sets to high risk with adversarial cases

Labels: `Extensions` `Security` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P5-02, P3-06

Sets that read web pages start with the strictest targets.

Acceptance criteria:

- Sets using the web page adapter default to the high-risk tier.
- Their gate dataset includes adversarial cases.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#state-is-untrusted`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/confidence-policy.md#default-thresholds-by-risk-tier`

#### P6-08 Review the extension against the threat model

Labels: `Security review` `Security` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P6-02, P6-04, P6-05, P6-06

The Security reviewer signs off before the extension ships.

Acceptance criteria:

- Permissions, token storage, prompt injection handling and the autonomy rule are reviewed and signed off.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#extensions`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#state-is-untrusted`

Note: Added: phase-6.md names the Security reviewer as an owner without a checklist line.

#### P6-09 Pass the Phase 6 exit gate

Labels: `QA / Evals` `Security` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P6-07, P6-08

Confirm the extension is safe to ship.

Acceptance criteria:

- No TypeSafe key anywhere in the extension.
- Nothing is sent before the user clicks.
- Evaluate mode works on three sample pages. The action picker completes one scripted task on an allowlisted test site.
- An injected-instruction test page does not trigger an autonomous click.

### Bandwise P7: MCP HTTP and Claude Code plugin

MCP HTTP transport, the Claude Code plugin with the bandwise-operator and bandwise-integrate skills, and a marketplace entry.

Lead role: Integrations. Depends on: Bandwise P3: Console and management API, Bandwise P3b: Effectiveness loop, Bandwise P4b: Integrate and deploy. Needs the Phase 3 operations and Phase 4b; the Phase 3b tools must exist. Runs in parallel with P6. Checklist: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-7.md`. 6 issues, 18 points.

#### P7-01 Add the MCP HTTP transport and any missing 3b and 4b tools

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P3-25, P3b-05, P3b-09, P3b-13, P3b-18, P3b-23, P3b-26, P4b-04, P4b-09

Hosted agents reach Bandwise over MCP HTTP.

Acceptance criteria:

- `packages/mcp-server` serves the HTTP transport next to stdio.
- Every Phase 3b and 4b curated tool in headless-and-agents.md is present.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#mcp-server`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-7.md`

#### P7-02 Authenticate the MCP server with an agent token only

Labels: `Integrations` `Security` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P7-01

MCP never holds an app token or a TypeSafe key.

Acceptance criteria:

- Auth uses `BANDWISE_TOKEN` or a `bandwise login` profile.
- A test rejects an `sk_` app token. No TypeSafe key is ever read.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#mcp-server`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/security.md#agent-tokens`

#### P7-03 Package plugins/claude-code with bandwise-operator and bandwise-integrate

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:docs` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 5 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P7-01

Customers install one Claude Code plugin to run Bandwise from a prompt.

Acceptance criteria:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.mcp.json` with one server entry per profile.
- `bandwise-operator` moves sets through rollout stages, reads disagreements and health, knows when an approval is needed, and tells app code to branch only on `effectiveAction` and `route`.
- `bandwise-integrate` loads the official `typesafe` skill, posts opportunity summaries (never source code), builds the set, then runs `bandwise codegen` and `bandwise check`.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/headless-and-agents.md#customer-claude-code-skills-phase-7`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-7.md`

#### P7-04 Keep the bandwise-builder skill out of the plugin

Labels: `Integrations` `Security` | Estimate: 1 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P7-03

The internal builder skill never ships to customers.

Acceptance criteria:

- A packaging check fails if any file from `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder` is in the plugin output.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-7.md`, `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/SKILL.md`

#### P7-05 Publish a marketplace repo or local marketplace entry

Labels: `Integrations` `bandwise:docs` | Estimate: 2 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P7-03

Customers install the plugin with one command.

Acceptance criteria:

- `claude plugin install` works from the marketplace entry.

Refs: `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-7.md`

#### P7-06 Pass the Phase 7 exit gate

Labels: `QA / Evals` `bandwise:headless` | Estimate: 3 | State: Backlog | Blocked by: P7-02, P7-04, P7-05

Confirm Bandwise runs from a Claude Code prompt.

Acceptance criteria:

- `claude plugin install` works from the marketplace.
- In a sample repo, "set up Bandwise in this app" produces an opportunity, a set and a generated typed client.
- "Run the triage set on this text" returns a `RunResult` with bands.
- A prompt to publish to production on a protected or live set returns a pending approval until a person approves it.
- The MCP inspector passes.

## 4. Machine-readable backlog

The project, milestones, and labels already exist in NSIMS. Create the issues in array order in project `Bandwise` with their `milestone`, `labels`, `estimate`, and `state`. Record each `localId` to `NSI-n` mapping, and add the `blockedBy` relations only after every issue exists, because a few issues (P3-02, P3-13, P4b-08) wait on a higher local ID. Before creating an issue, search the Bandwise project for its `Local ID:` line, so a rerun never duplicates work.

Moves toward safety are never gated.

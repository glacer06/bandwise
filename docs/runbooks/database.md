# Runbook: database migrations

Production Postgres is a Supabase project (ADR-018). Bandwise uses it as plain Postgres: our Drizzle migrations, our roles (`bandwise_app`, `bandwise_platform`) and our RLS. Migrations run from one manual GitHub workflow, `.github/workflows/db-migrate.yml`. Nobody runs `pnpm db:migrate` against production from a laptop.

## One-time setup

1. In GitHub, open Settings, then Environments, and create two environments: `preview` and `production`. On `production`, add Nick (or PJ) as a required reviewer, so every production run waits for a person to approve it.
2. On each environment, add the secret `DATABASE_URL_MIGRATE`: the **direct** connection string for that database, as the migrating role (on Supabase, `postgres`). From the Supabase dashboard: Connect, then Direct connection. It looks like `postgresql://postgres:<password>@db.<project-ref>.supabase.co:5432/postgres`. Paste it into the GitHub form only. Never paste it into chat, an issue, a commit or a shell history.
3. Optional, on each environment: the secret `DATABASE_CA_CERT`, the PEM text of Supabase's server CA (Project Settings, Database, SSL configuration, download the certificate). With it set, the migrator uses TLS and checks the server certificate against that CA. Leave `sslmode` out of the URL then, because node-postgres lets URL parameters replace the CA setting. Without it, add the SSL parameters Supabase documents to the URL. If node-postgres rejects the certificate, set `DATABASE_CA_CERT`.
4. `preview` points at a Supabase branch or a separate dev project, never at production.

**IPv4.** Supabase's direct connection hostname resolves to IPv6 only, unless the project has the IPv4 add-on. GitHub-hosted runners have no IPv6, so the job fails to connect. Either turn on the IPv4 add-on (keeps the direct connection) or, with Nick's sign-off, use the Supavisor **session** pooler string (port 5432 on the pooler host), which supports everything a migration does. Never use the transaction pooler (port 6543) for migrations: the workflow refuses a URL on port 6543.

## Run a migration

1. Merge the migration to `main`. The CI gate has already run it on PGlite.
2. Actions, then Database migrate, then Run workflow. Pick `preview` first. Or: `gh workflow run db-migrate.yml -f environment=preview`.
3. The log shows one line: `applied N migration(s), seeded M platform row(s)`. It never prints the URL. On a failure it prints the Postgres error with the URL and password removed.
4. Check the preview app, then run it again with `production` and approve the run.

Re-running is safe. Applied migrations are recorded by hash in `bandwise_migrations` and skipped, and the platform seed never overwrites existing rows.

## Supabase notes

- **App traffic** from Vercel goes through the Supavisor pooler in transaction mode (port 6543) with prepared statements off. `set_config('app.org_id', ..., true)` is transaction-local, so tenant context never leaks between pooled clients.
- **Migrations** use the direct connection (see IPv4 above). They run in one transaction and need a session that lasts the whole run.
- **Data API off.** In the dashboard, turn the Data API off (or expose no schema to it). The anon and service keys are never used by any Bandwise app.
- **Migration 0002 (`0002_close_data_api_roles.sql`).** A fresh Supabase project grants `anon`, `authenticated` and `service_role` every privilege on new tables, sequences and functions in `public` through default privileges owned by `postgres` and `supabase_admin`, plus USAGE on the schema. `service_role` also has BYPASSRLS. Migration 0002, for each of those roles that exists:
  - revokes all privileges on every table, sequence and routine in `public`, and USAGE and CREATE on the schema;
  - revokes their default privileges (tables, sequences, functions; per schema and global) for the migrating role, `postgres` and `supabase_admin`, where the migrating role is a member of that owner. On Supabase `postgres` is not a member of `supabase_admin`, so those defaults stay and the migration logs a NOTICE. They only apply to objects `supabase_admin` creates, and we create none;
  - revokes USAGE on `public` from PUBLIC (every role inherits PUBLIC), after granting USAGE and CREATE to the migrating role. `bandwise_app` and `bandwise_platform` keep their explicit grants from 0001.
- **The guard.** After every run, in the same transaction, the migrator lists anything in `public` (tables, views, sequences, partitions and the schema itself) that one of the three roles can use. If the list is not empty the run fails and rolls back, naming the role and object. Fix the migration or revoke the manual grant; do not loosen the guard.
- **Migration 0004 (`0004_supabase_performance_advisor.sql`).** From the performance advisor pass of 2026-09-28. It adds an index for each of 23 foreign keys and replaces every RLS policy: settings are read once per statement, and no role has two permissive policies for the same table and command (`.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/data-model.md`, RLS policy template). Access for `bandwise_app` is unchanged. `bandwise_platform` loses the rows of whatever org `app.org_id` named on `price_books`, `audit_log` and `events`, which no code used. The indexes are plain `CREATE INDEX`, because a migration runs in one transaction and `CONCURRENTLY` cannot. That blocks writes to each table while its index builds, which is instant on the empty production database. A later index on a table with real traffic needs its own plan.

## After a production run: re-run the advisors

Open the Supabase dashboard, then Advisors, and check Performance and Security (or ask an agent to run the Supabase MCP `get_advisors` for the project, type `performance`, then `security`). After 0004, `unindexed_foreign_keys`, `auth_rls_initplan` and `multiple_permissive_policies` should be gone. `unused_index` grows by 26 findings for 0004's 23 indexes, because the advisor reports the partitioned `runs (org_id, version_id)` index once per partition (4 today), and they stay until real traffic uses them; ignore it until then, and ignore `auth_db_connections_absolute`. Anything else new is a finding: open an issue before the next migration.

## The app login role

The app never connects as `postgres`. After the first migration, create a login role that is a member of `bandwise_app` (NOLOGIN, no BYPASSRLS). Run this as the migrating role in the Supabase SQL editor or `psql`:

```sql
CREATE ROLE bandwise_console LOGIN INHERIT NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE IN ROLE bandwise_app;
```

Then set its password with `\password bandwise_console` in `psql`, which prompts and never writes the password to a log or history. Generate the password in the team vault and keep it there. It goes from the vault into Vercel's `DATABASE_URL` for that environment, never into chat, a ticket or the repo. Through Supavisor the user name is `bandwise_console.<project-ref>`. To rotate it, follow the next section; do not change the password in place on a live deployment.

### Rotate the app role's password

A Postgres role has one password, and Supavisor checks it on every new connection. Change it in place and every deployment that still holds the old `DATABASE_URL` fails to open new connections, while the connections it already has keep working. So some runs fail and most do not, until the new deployment is live. That is what happened on 2026-10-05: `alter role bandwise_console with password` ran from the dashboard at 22:17:05 UTC, and two hook runs at 22:17:18 and 22:19:00 got `503` while the runs around them worked. Supavisor logged `ClientHandler: Exchange error: password authentication failed for user "bandwise_console"` for each one. Postgres logged nothing, because Supavisor checks the password itself.

Rotate through a second login role instead, so a working password exists at every moment:

1. Create the spare role once, with the same line as above but named `bandwise_console_b`. Set its new password with `\password bandwise_console_b` in `psql`, from the vault.
2. Put the new string, user `bandwise_console_b.<project-ref>`, into Vercel's `DATABASE_URL` for that environment. Redeploy, and wait until the new deployment is the current one.
3. Check one hook run answers 200, and the Supavisor log shows logins for `bandwise_console_b`.
4. Only then lock the old role: `ALTER ROLE bandwise_console NOLOGIN;`. The next rotation goes the other way: new password on `bandwise_console`, `ALTER ROLE bandwise_console LOGIN;`, switch Vercel back, redeploy, then `NOLOGIN` on `bandwise_console_b`.

If you must change the password in place, expect failed runs on new connections until the new deployment is live, and do it while hooks are idle.

### When the run log says DbConnectionError

The run route logs one line per unexpected failure, `run <requestId>: <type>`, with the error type and its causes but never a message. A database failure reads like `DbConnectionError auth_failed < Error`. The word after `DbConnectionError` says why the pool could not connect:

| Code | Look at |
|---|---|
| `auth_failed` | The password in Vercel's `DATABASE_URL` does not match the role. Check the Supavisor (pooler) logs in the Supabase dashboard, source `supavisor_logs`, not the Postgres logs. A rotation still in progress is the usual cause. |
| `too_many_connections` | Supavisor's client limit or Postgres `max_connections`. The console pool holds 3 connections per instance. |
| `timeout` | No connection within 5 seconds: either the pooler did not answer, or all 3 of the instance's connections stayed busy that long. Check Supabase status and the Supavisor logs, then slow queries in the Postgres logs. |
| `network` | The socket was refused, reset or closed, including a pooled connection that died before `BEGIN`. The pool drops that connection and opens a new one next time. Check Supabase status and the pooler host and port in `DATABASE_URL`. |
| `unknown` | The Supavisor and Postgres logs at that minute. |

A failed query inside a transaction reads like `DrizzleQueryError < DatabaseError 40P01`, with the SQLSTATE; that one is in the Postgres logs.

A pooled connection that fails while idle logs `db pool: idle connection failed: <type>` and nothing else happens: the pool drops it and opens a new one on the next request. A few around a Supavisor restart are normal. A steady stream means the pooler is closing connections, so check the Supavisor logs.

The response to the caller is still `503 system_one_unavailable` with a fixed message, because api.md has no code for a database failure yet. Trust the log line, not the code, for the cause.

## Rollback

- A failed migration step changes nothing: all pending migrations and the guard run in one transaction. The platform seed runs after it in its own transaction, so a seed failure leaves the migrations applied; fix the cause and run the workflow again.
- Migrations are forward only. To undo an applied one, write a new migration that reverses it. Never edit an applied migration file: its hash changes and the migrator would try to apply it again.
- Do not add a migration that grants `anon`, `authenticated` or `service_role` anything. If a Supabase feature ever needs it, that is an ADR first.
- Data loss or a bad data change: restore from Supabase backups (point-in-time recovery where the plan has it) into a new project, check it, then repoint `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_MIGRATE`.

# Runbook: turn on hosted dogfood (D2e)

Phase D of ADR-020. This is the ordered checklist that takes the `internal` org live on app.bandwise.dev, so the Claude Code hooks on this repo call `POST /api/v1/sets/{slug}/run` with a Bandwise token instead of TypeSafe with Nick's own key. Every set starts in `shadow`, so nothing a hook does changes while this rolls out.

Each step says who does it:

- **Nick**: Nick only. Every step that touches a secret value is Nick's.
- **PJ**: PJ's Security check. Do not go past a PJ step until PJ has signed it off.

No secret value goes into this file, a ticket, chat, a commit or a shell history. Secrets go from the team vault into Vercel, the Keychain, or a `read -s` prompt.

**Status, 2026-10-05.** Sections 1 to 7 are done for Nick: the `internal` org is live, the hooks on this repo call the hosted run endpoint, and the live publish and rollback passed. Still open: PJ's console sign-in and audit check, PJ's tokens, revoking the tokens minted under the old pepper (section 8), and rotating the `bandwise_console` database password.

## 0. Before you start

- [x] **PJ.** Security review and merge on `main`: D2a (PR #20), and D2b to D3 with this bootstrap script (PR #21, merged 2026-10-01 on Nick's go after PJ's three review passes).
- [x] **Hook token, decided 2026-10-01 (Nick).** The hooks get a run-only `sa_live_` agent token: scope `run` only, role ceiling `viewer`, the four dogfood sets, 90 days. It follows `security.md` (the CLI uses agent tokens only), it dies when Nick's membership goes, and it can do nothing but run those four sets. The Claude Code session can read every variable the hooks see, so this is the only Bandwise token that shell ever holds.
- [ ] **Nick.** The `bandwise-console` Vercel project and the `bandwise_console` login role exist from the early-access go-live ([early-access.md](early-access.md)). If not, do that runbook first.
- [ ] **Nick.** `jq` installed (`brew install jq`) for the checks below.

## 1. Apply the migrations

Migrations run from the Database migrate workflow, never from a laptop ([database.md](database.md)). `pnpm db:migrate` is the same migrator; the workflow runs it with `DATABASE_URL` set to the `DATABASE_URL_MIGRATE` secret of the GitHub environment, which is the direct connection as `postgres`.

There is one database today, production. The `preview` GitHub environment has no `DATABASE_URL_MIGRATE`, so a preview run stops at "Check the secret is set" without connecting. Skip it until a preview database exists.

1. **Nick** starts the workflow on `production`: `gh workflow run db-migrate.yml -f environment=production`. **PJ** approves the run as the required reviewer, so no one moves production alone. The log line is `applied N migration(s), seeded M platform row(s)`.
2. Done 2026-10-01: run #7 applied 0006 and 0007 after PJ's approval, and the checks below passed (7 rows, the seed, the role check, no security advisors). The follow-up PR adds 0008 (`run_limits`); run the workflow again when it merges and expect 8 rows.
3. **Nick.** Verify in the Supabase SQL editor (it runs as `postgres`):

   ```sql
   -- One row per file in packages/db/migrations on main: 7 on 2026-10-01, 8 once 0008 run_limits merges.
   select count(*) from bandwise_migrations;
   -- The model registry seed is there: expect jev-1.13.0 among the rows.
   select id, kind, status from system_one_models order by id;
   -- The app login role: no BYPASSRLS, a member of bandwise_app, not of bandwise_platform.
   select rolbypassrls,
          pg_has_role('bandwise_console', 'bandwise_app', 'member') as app,
          pg_has_role('bandwise_console', 'bandwise_platform', 'member') as platform
   from pg_roles where rolname = 'bandwise_console';
   ```

   Expect `false`, `true`, `false` on the last query.
4. **Nick.** Re-run the Supabase advisors (database.md, "After a production run"). Anything new is a finding for PJ.

## 2. Vercel env for `apps/console`

**Nick** sets these on the `bandwise-console` project, **Production only**. Preview gets none of them: previews never touch production data or keys (ADR-018).

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Supavisor **transaction** pooler (port 6543), user `bandwise_console.<project-ref>`, password from the vault | Already set for early access. Never the `postgres` user. |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | 32 or more random characters | Already set for early access. |
| `BANDWISE_TOKEN_PEPPER` | New: `openssl rand -base64 48` on your machine | Store it in the team vault in the same minute; the mint script needs the same value (section 4). Changing it later invalidates every token. |
| `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | A TypeSafe key for the platform, from the vault | Use a key made for the hosted server, not your personal shell key, so either can be revoked alone and spend shows apart. |
| `SYSTEM_ONE_TRANSPORT` | `sdk` | Without it the server answers from synthetic fixtures. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | `https://app.bandwise.dev` | Turns on console sign-in (D3). Unset, sign-in is off and the API still serves. Sign-in reuses `AUTH_SECRET`; there is no `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`. |
| `BANDWISE_CONSOLE_EMAILS` | Optional: Nick's and PJ's emails, comma separated | An allowlist on top of the `internal` membership. See `docs/runbooks/console-access.md`. |

Leave `BANDWISE_KEK`, `BANDWISE_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_*` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset. Nothing in D2 uses them.

Then redeploy production (Deployments, the latest production deployment, Redeploy), because env changes apply at the next deploy.

**Check (Nick).** A run with no token must get 401. A 503 means a variable or the database is wrong. The function log shows `run <requestId>: <type>`, the error type and its causes and never a message, on purpose: `TokenPepperError` or `ServerEnvError` is a variable, `DbConnectionError auth_failed` is the database password (see [database.md](database.md), "When the run log says DbConnectionError").

```sh
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -X POST https://app.bandwise.dev/api/v1/sets/done-check/run
```

**PJ.** Check in Vercel that Preview has none of the variables above, and that only Nick and PJ can read Production env.

Done 2026-10-01 (PJ, on Nick's handoff): `BANDWISE_TOKEN_PEPPER` (in the team vault), `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` (the dedicated hosted-server key), `SYSTEM_ONE_TRANSPORT`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and `BANDWISE_CONSOLE_EMAILS` set on Production only; `DATABASE_URL` and `AUTH_SECRET` confirmed; Preview unchanged. Production redeployed, and the unauthenticated run call returns 401. Still open: a signed-in call (section 6) and the check that only Nick and PJ can read Production env.

## 3. Bootstrap the `internal` org

**Nick.** In this repo on `main`, in a fresh terminal. The script reads `DATABASE_URL` from the shell. Use the same `bandwise_console` pooler string as Vercel, so the bootstrap runs under RLS like the app.

```sh
read -s "PW?bandwise_console password: " && export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://bandwise_console.<project-ref>:${PW}@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"; unset PW
echo "$DATABASE_URL" | sed -E 's#(//[^:]+:).*@#\1***@#'
pnpm -s --filter @bandwise/console bootstrap-internal --owner <nick's email> --member <pj's email>:admin
```

The vault holds the password only, so the first line builds the URL around it. Use the shared pooler host on port 6543: the direct `db.<project-ref>.supabase.co` host is IPv6 only. The `sed` line shows the URL with the whole password masked, even when the password contains `@`.

It creates, in one transaction, only what is missing:

- the org `internal` in platform key mode, on plan `internal`;
- Nick as owner and PJ as admin (an existing user row with the same email is reused);
- project `dogfood`, its goal, and the app `Claude Code hooks` (unused for now: the hooks run on an agent token, section 4);
- one set per `.bandwise/sets/*.json`, slug = file name, published as version 1 on `production` at `shadow`, with an open draft version 2;
- an audit row for every step, with `source: bootstrap-internal` in the diff.

It prints ids and slugs only:

```
org <uuid> internal created
member <uuid> owner created
member <uuid> admin created
project <uuid>
goal <uuid>
app <uuid>
set <uuid> action-risk-gate created
...
set_ids <uuid>,<uuid>,<uuid>,<uuid>
```

Keep that output in this terminal for section 4. Running it again prints the same ids with `exists` and writes nothing. A set whose file changed since prints `differs` and is left alone: change a live set with `bandwise spec push` and `bandwise publish`, never by re-running the bootstrap.

**PJ.** Read the audit rows (SQL editor):

```sql
select action, target_type, target_id, diff, created_at
from audit_log
where org_id = (select id from organizations where slug = 'internal')
order by created_at;
```

Expect `org.create`, two `member.add`, `project.create`, `goal.create`, `app.create`, and one `set.create` and one `set.publish` per set.

Done 2026-10-05 (Nick): the org, both members and the four sets were created. PJ's audit check is still open.

**Console sign-in.** With `AUTH_SECRET` and `BETTER_AUTH_URL` also set in the shell, run `console-member` once for Nick and once for PJ with the org uuid above and the same roles. It reuses the user and membership the bootstrap made and writes a one-time reset link and a two-factor enrollment code to `~/.bandwise/console-reset-link.txt`. Hand both to the person over a private channel. They set a password, then set up two-factor with the code. A password alone cannot enroll an authenticator. See `docs/runbooks/console-access.md`.

To hand PJ the file without showing it: `pbcopy < <file>`, paste into a vault note shared with PJ only, check the note shows both lines, then `rm <file> && pbcopy < /dev/null`. Copy nothing else in between, or the clipboard loses the link. The person signs in at `https://app.bandwise.dev/sign-in` after setting the password.

Done 2026-10-05: Nick signed in with two-factor. PJ's link is in a shared vault note.

## 4. Mint the tokens

**Nick**, same terminal (it already has `DATABASE_URL`). Load the pepper from the vault without echoing it:

```sh
read -s "BANDWISE_TOKEN_PEPPER?Token pepper: " && export BANDWISE_TOKEN_PEPPER
```

Each command prints the token once, on stdout, and its row id on stderr. The one-line form below captures the token in a shell variable, writes it straight into the Keychain and unsets the variable, so it never shows on screen, never touches the clipboard, and never goes through the Keychain password prompt. That prompt fails on a long pasted value ("passwords don't match"), and copying the row id after a clipboard mint overwrites the token, so do not use either. `-U` replaces an older item with the same name. The token is a process argument for a moment, which is fine on your own Mac.

**Hook token** (an `sa_live_` agent token: `run` only, role ceiling `viewer`, the four dogfood sets, 90 days):

```sh
T=$(pnpm -s --filter @bandwise/console mint-token agent --org <org uuid> --user <owner uuid> --name nick-hooks --role viewer --scopes run --sets <set_ids line> --days 90) && security add-generic-password -U -a "$USER" -s BANDWISE_TOKEN -w "$T"; unset T
security find-generic-password -a "$USER" -s BANDWISE_TOKEN -w | cut -c1-8
```

The check prints `sa_live_` and nothing else. A token is 84 characters: `echo ${#BANDWISE_TOKEN}` in a new terminal.

**CLI token for Nick** (an `sa_live_` agent token, 90 days at most):

```sh
T=$(pnpm -s --filter @bandwise/console mint-token agent --org <org uuid> --user <owner uuid> --name nick-cli --role editor --scopes run,sets:read,sets:write,release:production,runs:read,usage:read --days 90) && security add-generic-password -U -a "$USER" -s BANDWISE_AGENT_TOKEN -w "$T"; unset T
security find-generic-password -a "$USER" -s BANDWISE_AGENT_TOKEN -w | cut -c1-8
```

For PJ, run the agent commands with PJ's member uuid and `--name pj-hooks` and `--name pj-cli`, but send each token to a vault item only PJ can read instead of the Keychain: `T=$(...) && printf %s "$T" | pbcopy; unset T`, paste into the vault item, then `pbcopy < /dev/null`. PJ loads them into PJ's own Keychain. Note the token row ids from stderr; section 8 needs them to revoke. Then clear this terminal's secrets and close it:

```sh
unset DATABASE_URL BANDWISE_TOKEN_PEPPER AUTH_SECRET BETTER_AUTH_URL
```

**A 401 in section 6 with a token that is 84 characters means the pepper differs.** The server hashes the token with Vercel's `BANDWISE_TOKEN_PEPPER` and finds no row. Neither copy can be read back, so do not compare: make a new pepper from one source and put the same bytes everywhere, then mint again.

```sh
P=$(openssl rand -hex 32); export BANDWISE_TOKEN_PEPPER="$P"; echo ${#P}
printf %s "$P" | pbcopy
```

Paste it over the Vercel value (Production) and save, run the `printf` line again and paste it over the vault entry, then `pbcopy < /dev/null`, redeploy Production, load `DATABASE_URL` as in section 3, and mint both tokens again in this terminal. Then `unset DATABASE_URL BANDWISE_TOKEN_PEPPER P`. The pepper is used only for API, run and MCP tokens, so changing it signs nobody out of the console. Every token minted before stops working.

Done 2026-10-05 (Nick): the first mint hit this 401, the pepper was replaced from one source as above, and `nick-hooks` and `nick-cli` were minted again. PJ's tokens are still open.

**PJ.** Check the token rows match what was asked, and that no token value is stored anywhere:

```sql
select action, diff from audit_log
where org_id = (select id from organizations where slug = 'internal')
  and action = 'agent_token.create'
order by created_at;
```

`nick-hooks` should show `scopes: ["run"]`, `roleCeiling: viewer` and the four set ids; each CLI token its six scopes and `roleCeiling: editor`.

## 5. Shell and hook env

**Nick.** The hooks inherit the environment of the shell that starts Claude Code, so that shell gets only the run-only hook token. Add to `~/.zshrc`:

```sh
export BANDWISE_TOKEN="$(security find-generic-password -a "$USER" -s BANDWISE_TOKEN -w 2>/dev/null)"
export BANDWISE_MCP_TOKEN="$BANDWISE_TOKEN"
# Management commands use the agent token for one command at a time; it never sits in the session env.
bwa() { BANDWISE_TOKEN="$(security find-generic-password -a "$USER" -s BANDWISE_AGENT_TOKEN -w 2>/dev/null)" pnpm -s bandwise "$@"; }
```

Keep `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in `~/.zshrc` for now: it is the fallback in section 8. `BANDWISE_BASE_URL` stays unset; it defaults to `https://app.bandwise.dev`. Nothing in `.claude/settings.json` changes: with `BANDWISE_TOKEN` set, `bandwise hook` calls the hosted endpoint ([dogfood.md](dogfood.md), section 4).

Open a new terminal so the change loads.

## 6. Verify

**Nick**, in the new terminal.

One run with the hook token. The token goes to curl on stdin, so it is not in the process list or the history:

```sh
printf 'header = "authorization: Bearer %s"\n' "$BANDWISE_TOKEN" | curl -sS --config - \
  -X POST https://app.bandwise.dev/api/v1/sets/done-check/run \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data "{\"state\": $(cat .bandwise/states/done-check/example-2-claims-success-without-a-check.json)}" \
  | jq '{status, version, rollout, modelResolved, runBand, overallAction}'
```

Expect `status: "ok"`, `version: 1`, `rollout: "shadow"` and `modelResolved: "jev-1.13.0"`. A `401` means the token or the pepper does not match; a `404` means the org is not `internal` or the set is not in the token's allowlist; a `503` is the env or the database, and the function log line says which (section 2).

Then the server's side, with the agent token:

```sh
bwa report --remote --since 1h
```

`done-check` should show one run. Then start a new Claude Code session in this repo, send one prompt, and run `pnpm bandwise report --since 1h` (local receipts, now marked `provider: bandwise`) and `bwa report --remote --since 1h` (server runs). Both should show `model-tier`.

The remote report books no savings for shadow runs (`savingsSuppressed`), while the local report prices its own estimate, so the two savings columns differ by design. `--since` is an exact timestamp on the server; the header prints dates only.

Done 2026-10-05: `status: ok`, version 1, `shadow`, `jev-1.13.0`, and both reports showed all three hook sets. Two calls about 22:17 UTC returned a 503 with no outgoing request and recovered on their own; that is tracked separately.

## 7. One live publish and rollback

**Nick.** This proves a change reaches the next hook call with no redeploy, and that rollback restores it. It uses a harmless change on the server draft only; the repo file stays as it is.

```sh
jq '.input.schema.description = "D2e live publish check"' .bandwise/sets/done-check.json > /tmp/done-check-d2e.json
bwa spec push /tmp/done-check-d2e.json --set done-check
bwa publish done-check --changelog "D2e live publish check"
# Run the curl from section 6 again: expect version 2.
bwa rollback done-check
# The curl again: expect version 1.
bwa spec push .bandwise/sets/done-check.json --set done-check
bwa spec diff .bandwise/sets/done-check.json
```

The last command exits 0 when the server draft matches the file again. Publishing at `shadow` needs no approval. Moving a set to `controlled` does, and the approval is decided by a signed-in person, so that waits for the D3 console sign-in.

Done 2026-10-05: version 2 reached the next call with no redeploy, rollback returned version 1, and `spec diff` matched the file.

## 8. Rollback plan

Every step above can be undone without touching data:

- **Hooks back to local live mode (Nick, seconds).** Remove the `BANDWISE_TOKEN` export from `~/.zshrc`, `unset BANDWISE_TOKEN`, start a new session. The hooks call TypeSafe with `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` again, exactly as before D2e.
- **A bad version (Nick or PJ).** `bwa rollback <set>` points production back at the previous version. Rollback is a move toward safety and is never gated. It only steps back, to an older version this channel has served before. That includes a version that was itself rolled back for being bad, so read the version number it prints, and pass `--to <n>` when the one right before is not the one you want.
- **A set misbehaving.** `bwa rollout <set> paused --reason "..."`. Paused never acts and is never gated.
- **A leaked token (Nick or PJ, at once).** Until the console can revoke tokens (D3), revoke it in the SQL editor with its audit row, then mint a new one (section 4). The token id is the mint's stderr line or the `target_id` of its `app_token.create` audit row. The server refuses a revoked token within a minute.

  ```sql
  begin;
  update agent_tokens set revoked_at = now() where id = '<token id>';
  insert into audit_log (org_id, actor_type, client, actor_user_id, action, target_type, target_id)
  values ((select id from organizations where slug = 'internal'), 'user', 'console', '<your user uuid>',
          'agent_token.revoke', 'agent_token', '<token id>');
  commit;
  ```
- **The pepper leaked.** Generate a new one, set it in Vercel and the vault, redeploy, and mint every token again. Every old token stops working.
- **Turn hosted runs off entirely.** Remove `BANDWISE_TOKEN_PEPPER` from Vercel Production and redeploy: every run answers 503 and nothing reaches TypeSafe. Keep the pepper in the vault; putting it back restores every token. Hooks fail open, so sessions keep working. Do not turn it off by removing `SYSTEM_ONE_TRANSPORT`: the server would then answer from synthetic fixtures.

## Sign-in safeguards

- **Attempt limits are shared.** The per-email and per-IP sign-in limits live in `auth_attempts` (migration 0007), so they hold across every Vercel instance. Keys are stored as SHA-256 hashes. The IP comes from `x-real-ip`, which Vercel sets; `x-forwarded-for` is never read. TOTP codes also hit the library's database lockout (10 tries, then 15 minutes).
- **Two-factor enrollment is admin-issued.** Setup needs the enrollment code from `console-member` as well as the password, and the code is used up when two-factor turns on. A lost phone: delete the person's `two_factors` row and set `users.two_factor_enabled` to false (see console-access.md), then run `console-member` again for a new reset link and code.

## Hook safeguards and what they do not cover

- **The hooks fail open.** Any error, a timeout, a revoked token or a server that is down ends the hook with exit 0 and no output. Nothing blocks, and Claude Code carries on as if the hook were not there. That matches live mode. A revoked hook token therefore turns blocking off silently. Watch for `unauthenticated` or `network_error` statuses in `pnpm bandwise report --since 1d`.
- **Per-token and per-org rate and spend caps.** Every hosted run is a real call on the platform key, so each caller (an agent or app token, or the person in a console session for draft previews) gets two limits, and the org gets the same two over all its callers, so minting another token buys no more budget. They are constants in `apps/console/src/server/run/limits.ts`:
  - **Rate:** 120 runs per minute per caller (`HOSTED_RUNS_PER_WINDOW`) and 300 per org (`HOSTED_ORG_RUNS_PER_WINDOW`), in fixed one-minute windows. Past either the API answers `429 rate_limited` with `Retry-After` set to the seconds left in the window.
  - **Spend:** 5 USD of System One and escalation cost per UTC day per caller (`HOSTED_DAILY_SPEND_CAP_MICRO_USD`) and 20 USD per org (`HOSTED_ORG_DAILY_SPEND_CAP_MICRO_USD`). Each run reserves 1 cent (`HOSTED_RUN_SPEND_RESERVE_MICRO_USD`) from both before it calls System One, and the reservation is settled to the cost in the run's envelope when the run is stored, in the same transaction. Once a reservation would pass either cap the API answers `402 token_budget_exceeded` until midnight UTC. A run can finish over the cap only by what it cost beyond its 1 cent; the next one is refused.

  All counts live in `run_limits` (migration 0008), one row per key, so they hold across every Vercel instance. Keys are SHA-256 hashes of the org and the token, key or user id. A refused run still gets a run row with status `rate_limited` or `quota_exceeded`, and the envelope carries its `runId`. The hook fails open on both, and the receipt shows the code: look for `rate_limited` or `token_budget_exceeded` in `pnpm bandwise report --since 1d`. A leaked token can therefore spend at most 5 USD a day on the four allowlisted sets, and all tokens together at most 20 USD. Revocation is still the way to stop it: the SQL in section 8 is ready to paste, and the server refuses a revoked token within a minute. To lift a cap for one day, delete that key's row; the hash is `sha256("bandwise-run-limit:spend:<org id>:agent:<token id>")` (or `:app:<key id>`, `:user:<user id>`, or `:org` for the org cap).
- **Revoke and lost-phone reset are manual SQL** with a hand-written audit row until D3 ops exist. PJ accepted this for dogfood on 2026-10-01. Keep section 8 current.

When this runbook is done, tick the D2e items in `.claude/skills/bandwise-builder/references/phases/phase-d.md` and note the date in [dogfood.md](dogfood.md).

// key cannot produce them on demand. With --model, the same requests go to that model (through its
// route row off TypeSafe) and land in fixtures/<provider>/<model>/, so the same questions on two
// models are two fixtures. Only the provider folder's own fixtures are sources: a model folder holds
// the same names, so reading it too would write one model's answers over another's. Request and
// generation ids are scrubbed, and each fixture records TypeSafe's live openapi.json info.version.

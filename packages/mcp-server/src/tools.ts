// The Bandwise Gate tool set (ADR-021 section 2): six preset tools, each over an operation the
// registry already has, so headless parity holds. The two check tools are presets of set.run on
// the org's done-check and action-risk sets; the other four pass their arguments to one
// operation. Publish, rollout, rollback, set editing and admin operations are never here.
//
// This file is data. The console builds the callable tools from it: it checks scopes, applies the
// redaction and runs the operation in process.
